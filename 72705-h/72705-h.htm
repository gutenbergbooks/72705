<div><span class='pageno' title='1' id='Page_1'></span><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER I<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE FALLING AIRPLANE</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>A grand</span> day for a spin in the air, Ned,” remarked
Tom Swift, as he stretched his arms and
looked through the window of his office. “What
do you say? Come along and let the wind blow
some of the cobwebs out of your brain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get thee behind me, Satan,” replied Ned
Newton, the young financial manager of the
Swift Construction Company. “I’ve got a heap
of work yet to do in checking up this last monthly
statement.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’ll keep,” said Tom. “You’ll find the
figures waiting patiently for you when you get
back. I know you’re well ahead of your work,
anyway, and a whirl in the circumambient will
do you good. You see, I’m only thinking of
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you are, you old hypocrite!” laughed
Ned, who was about the same age and on the
warmest terms of friendship with his talented
young employer. “I’ve known for the last half
hour that you weren’t paying any attention to
what I’ve been saying and that your fingers were
itching to get hold of the control lever of the
<span class='it'>Hummingbird</span>. Well, I suppose you’ve got to
get it out of your system, and it might as well
be now as later. You go and tune up the old
bus, and I’ll be with you just as soon as I’ve
given some directions to my stenographer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom went off to the flying field, where several
airplanes of his own construction, from the smallest
to the largest sizes, were kept in readiness for
use, and selected one which he had dubbed the
<span class='it'>Hummingbird</span> because of its diminutive size.
Ned had suggested the name, <span class='it'>Aerial Mosquito</span>,
but Tom had rejected this as casting a stigma
on his pet which had never “stung” them yet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was an attractive little craft, and Tom patted
it lovingly as he went over every strut of the
plane to see that it was in perfect condition.
Long experience in flying had taught him to
take nothing for granted. But there was nothing,
even to his critical eye, that was lacking, and
the same was true of the engine, which purred
smoothly as it broke into its rhythmical song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen to that!” Tom cried enthusiastically
to Ned, who by this time had rejoined him.
“Isn’t she humming sweetly? Never misses a
note. No grand opera prima donna has anything
on her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She sure sounds good,” agreed Ned, as he
climbed into his seat and adjusted his straps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With one last look that took in everything,
Tom followed him and started the plane. The
take-off was perfect. She ran along the ground
for a little distance and then soared into the air
like a bird. Tom let her climb, feeling out the
air currents, until they were at a height of about
eight hundred feet. Then he put her on a level
keel and settled back in his seat to enjoy his ride
to the full. At that moment he would not have
exchanged places with any one on earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was one of the perfect days that come in the
late spring. There was scarcely a cloud in the
sky. The sun was warm but not oppressive, and
was tempered by a light and refreshing breeze.
Below stretched a vast panorama of hill and valley
and woodland, the trees and meadows luxuriant
with their new coat of green. At the moment
they were above Lake Carlopa, and they
could see its waters gleaming like a mirror of
crystal beneath the rays of the sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some scenery!” exclaimed Tom jubilantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said it,” agreed Ned. “It reminds me
of that iceberg where we found the treasure——it’s
so different.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where we found the treasure but nearly lost
our lives,” replied Tom, his face growing a little
sober with the recollection. “Phew! it makes me
shiver just to think of it. We’ve been in some
pretty tight places, Ned, but that was the closest
squeak of all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t care to repeat it, for a fact,” said
Ned. “But I’ve no doubt that you’ll be going
into something just as dangerous before long.
You’re a glutton for danger. I’ll bet you’re just
pining for some other adventure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing in sight just now,” disclaimed Tom,
with a laugh. “But I’m not saying that if anything
beckoned I’d give it the glassy stare.
There are lots of things we haven’t tried yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to know what they are,” returned
Ned skeptically. “You’ve been near death as
many times as I have fingers and toes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet you’ll notice that I’m far from being
a dead one yet,” said Tom lightly. “Or if I
am dead, I’m a pretty lively corpse,” he added.
“Don’t worry about me, old man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The pitcher that goes to the well too often,
you know,” warned Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know that old wheeze,” laughed Tom.
“But I’m not a pitcher and——Great Scott!
what’s that fellow up to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The exclamation was wrenched from him by
the peculiar gyrations of an airplane about two
miles distant. They had noted its presence some
time previously, but as they were not far from
an aviation field and it was a common thing to
see planes flying about, they had not given it any
special attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, however, they noted that the plane was
behaving much as a ship might which had lost
its rudder. Its motions were confused and erratic.
It would plunge downward nose first and
then right itself abruptly and sail about in circles.
There seemed to be no coherent plan on the part
of the aviator, and indeed it acted as it might if
the aviator were missing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some fool aviator trying to do stunts,” was
Ned’s comment, after he had watched it for a
moment. “Those fellows make me tired. There
are risks enough in flying without going out of
the way to find them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t think it’s that,” said Tom anxiously.
“It looks to me as if the pilot were in
some sort of trouble. Lost control, sick, or
something. I’m going over to see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned the nose of his craft directly
toward the strange plane and made for it at full
speed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The queer contortions of the plane still persisted,
and Ned was by this time convinced that
Tom was right. A thrill of horror went through
them as the conviction grew upon them that they
might be about to witness a tragedy. If the
plane should dash to the ground from such a
height, there was not one chance in a thousand
that the luckless pilot would survive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They could see by this time that there was only
one man in the plane, which was a much larger
craft than their own. They could see him working
desperately to get his craft under control.
Where the trouble lay, whether with the plane
or the engine, they had no means of telling. But
that the man was in deadly danger and knew it,
there was no longer any room for doubt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had come within half a mile of the
strange airship when the disaster they had been
dreading happened. The plane suddenly turned
its nose to the earth until it pointed directly
downward. Then it fell like a plummet, down,
down, into the midst of a forest, where it landed
with a terrific crash and was lost to sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A cry of horror burst from Tom and Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quick, Tom!” cried the latter. “Can’t you
make a landing somewhere?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I’m looking for,” replied Tom,
as his eyes swept the surrounding country in
search of some open spot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he looked in vain. The woods extended
for several miles in every direction. Here and
there were small open places, but as Tom circled
about, flying as low as he could without striking
the tops of the trees, he saw that none of them
was large enough to permit the landing of the
plane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s but one thing to do,” he said in a
tense tone, when this conviction had become certainty.
“We’ve got to mark the location of this
place so that we can find it when we come to it
again. I’ll leave you to fix that in your mind.
Now we’ll make straight for home, get out my
roadster and try to get to the place as soon as
possible. The chances are that the poor fellow
is dead, but we’ll do all we can. You get busy
on the radio, so that the car will be all ready for
us to jump into the minute we get back to the
works.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned turned his attention to the radio set with
which the plane was equipped and called up
Garret Jackson, the shop manager for the Swift
Construction Company. He told of the accident
and directed Jackson to have Tom’s roadster
ready and the engine going.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom in the meantime had been making the
<span class='it'>Hummingbird</span> travel at her fastest speed, and only
a few minutes elapsed before they reached the
yards. He made a perfect landing, and before
the plane had fairly stopped he and Ned had
leaped from it and were running toward the
smart roadster, alongside of which Jackson was
standing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve put the first-aid kit under the seat in case
you should need it,” said Jackson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good work, Jackson,” commented the young
inventor, as he jumped in and took the wheel.
“Perhaps you’d better come along with us.
There may be work for all of us. All set? Let’s
go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He threw in the clutch and the speedy machine
started and was soon racing along at a record-breaking
speed in the direction of the woods. Although
they were fairly flying, it seemed to Tom
and Ned in their anxiety that they were crawling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give her the gas, Tom,” urged Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s making sixty now,” replied Tom, with
a glance at the speedometer. “Got the exact location,
Ned?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pretty nearly,” replied Ned. “Turn to the
right at the first road after we pass the church
at the forks. That’ll bring us to the Thaxton
woods in which the plane fell. There’s an old
woods road that runs through the center of the
forest, and if we keep our eyes open on either
side we’ll probably find it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon they had passed the church and turned
into the road that Ned had indicated. At that
point the going was good, but as they advanced
it gradually grew more rutted and rocky. Tom
kept up a high speed, however, though they had
to hold on and the car bounded up and down in
a manner that threatened wreck if the pace were
maintained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But a human life was in the balance, and if
that could be saved nothing else mattered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, deep in the woods, Tom slackened
speed, for the road had “petered out.” But he
could see that where it ceased to be a road it had
become a trail that wound its uneven way among
the trees. It was barely wide enough for the
car to pass along, and here and there in the road
were fragments of stumps that made traveling
precarious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gee, Tom, you’ll have to go slow here,”
declared Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We don’t want to break our necks,” added
Jackson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll do the best we can,” answered the
young inventor. “But if either of you wants to
get out and walk——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing doing, Tom!” cried his financial
manager quickly. “If you stick, so do I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Same here,” added the shop foreman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On and on they rushed. Once they hit a big
rock and for the moment it looked as if the
machine would surely go over. Ned and Jackson
held their breath. Maybe one or the other
thought the next minute would be his last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Tom was a skilled driver, and with almost
miraculous deftness he piloted the car at as fast
a rate as he dared. He could not take his eyes
from the road, but Ned scanned the woods on
one side and Jackson on the other for any sign
of the hapless airman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had gone perhaps half a mile when a
shout came from the lips of Jackson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The woods are afire!” he cried, as he pointed
ahead of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They looked in the direction indicated and saw
a column of flames mounting above the tree
tops.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span><h1>CHAPTER II<br/> <span class='sub-head'>ALMOST A TRAGEDY</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Tom Swift</span> and the two with him stared for
a moment in consternation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t the woods on fire,” cried Tom.
“They’re too green for that; and besides we had
a drenching storm two days ago. It’s the plane
that’s blazing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that poor fellow perhaps is being burned
to death!” cried Ned. “Hurry, Tom; hurry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no need for urging. Tom threw
caution to the winds and tore along at a reckless
pace in the direction of the flames.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he turned a bend in the trail, an exclamation
escaped him. Right in the road was a small
tree which had been blown down. It lay directly
in front of him, completely blocking the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had scarcely time to stop before colliding
with it. Then with one accord all leaped from
the car and tugged desperately at the tree to try
to move it to one side far enough to permit the
car to pass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although they put forth almost superhuman
efforts, they soon found that their strength was
unequal to the task. Tom was the first to realize
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No use, fellows,” he panted. “We’ll have to
leave the car here and make the rest of the way
on foot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They clambered over the tree and started running
with all their might in the direction of the
blazing plane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And while, with their hearts full of apprehension
and their lungs strained almost to bursting,
they are hastening to the rescue, it may be well
for the benefit of those who have not read the
preceding volumes of this series to tell who Tom
Swift was and what had been his adventures up
to the time this story opens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom, now about twenty-one years old, lived in
the town of Shopton, a small inland city on the
shores of Lake Carlopa. His father was Barton
Swift, an inventor of note. Tom had grown
up among wholesome surroundings and developed
into a clear-cut, athletic young fellow, a
general favorite among his associates. He was
frank, courageous and good-natured, never looking
for trouble but never stepping aside when it
turned up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom may have inherited the inventive genius
of his father, or it may have been the force of
example, but from his earliest years he displayed
a marvelous aptitude in all things scientific and
mechanical. A mere glance at any mechanical
contrivance, from a watch to a steam engine,
generally sufficed to give him a pretty clear idea
of its working. But this was not enough. He
saw not only its good qualities, but also its defects,
and his active mind busied itself at once
in trying to devise improvements. His success
in this had been phenomenal. From his first
venture into the realm of invention described in
the opening volume of the series, entitled “Tom,
Swift and His Motor Cycle,” his progress had
been rapid. His ambition grew from what it
fed upon, and the improvements that he added
to the motor cycle were duplicated by those described
in later volumes bearing on airships, submarines,
rifles, cameras, searchlights, cannon and
a host of other things that became famous. His
friends described him as a “wizard.” But Tom,
who was as modest as he was ingenious, never
thought of himself in that light. He was unspoiled
by praise and kept on devoting himself
to his chosen vocation. Like Alexander, he was
always looking for new worlds to conquer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The work that he had done naturally brought
with it large financial rewards. His activities resulted
in the formation of the Swift Construction
Company, which, starting on a small scale, had
attained great proportions and formed the leading
industry of the town of Shopton. In the development
of the business Tom had been greatly
aided by the financial ability of Ned Newton,
his closest friend. Ned had been a clerk in one
of the Shopton banks, but had left this position
to become treasurer of the Swift concern. He
was a genius in business management, and Tom
was able with an easy mind to leave all financial
details to Ned while he devoted himself to his
inventions. It was an ideal combination. They
were fortunate, too, in having at the head of the
mechanical department Garret Jackson, a thorough
mechanic himself and skilled in handling
the large body of workmen on the Swift payroll.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom did not care overmuch for money, but of
course he was glad that the business was prospering,
especially as at the present time he was
deeply interested in a charming young lady, Miss
Mary Nestor. The attachment between them had
grown rapidly of late and had been increased on
Mary’s part by a great service that Tom had recently
done in rescuing her father from an iceberg,
on which he had been marooned while in
a search for health. What peril was involved
in that rescue and how Tom’s courage and ingenuity
prevailed, are thrillingly told in the preceding
volume of this series entitled: “Tom Swift
and His Flying Boat; or, The Castaways of the
Giant Iceberg.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now to return to the three who were hastening
in the direction of the burning plane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It must be confessed that they had little hope
of being of use. The chances were great that
the aviator had not survived the fall. Still, there
was a chance, and that thought added wings to
their feet as they tore through the forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom was first on the scene, with Ned close at
his heels and Jackson bringing up the rear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Resting on two trees was most of what remained
of the doomed plane. It was still blazing
so fiercely that they could not approach it
closely. The motor had fallen through the trees
to the ground, together with part of the wreckage
of the plane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was nothing to be seen of the aviator,
and they scanned the ground fearfully. Their
first thought was that he must be lying crushed
under the heavy motor. That fate, tragic as it
was, would be better than being burned to death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly, Tom, who had been examining all
the trees that stood outlined in that great zone of
light, gave a startled exclamation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There he is!” he cried, as he pointed to the
branches of a tree fully fifty feet distant.
“There, in the crotch of those two big branches.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The others looked and saw the body of a man
at the place indicated, about twenty feet from
the ground. His torn clothing had caught in the
branches, and big boughs supported the greater
part of his weight. There was no sign of life
as they gazed at the crumpled mass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s been thrown or jumped from the plane!”
exclaimed Tom, as all three rushed to the tree.
“Here, Ned, give me your back and we’ll get him
down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned bent his back, and Tom, with Jackson’s
assistance, got up on it. Even then, with his
six feet of height and his long reach, he found
that he was several feet short of the lowest
branch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold steady, Ned, I’m going to jump,” he
warned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned braced himself, and Tom gave a mighty
leap, just clutching the bough with his out-stretched
hands. It was enough, however, and
he swung his legs up, and in a moment was in a
sitting position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Ned, you do the same thing,” he directed.
“I won’t be able to bring him down
alone. You stand by, Jackson, when we lower
him. In the meantime run back to the car and
get the coil of rope that’s under the seat. And
bring the first-aid kit along with you at the same
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jackson waited only long enough to enable
Ned to get up in the same way Tom had done,
and then set off on a run to the car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom and Ned made their way up through the
branches until they were close to the unfortunate
victim of the disaster. They had to proceed with
caution for fear the swaying of the branches
might release the body and let it fall to the
ground. But at last they were in a position
where they could see the man’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a youthful face, that of a young man
apparently no older than themselves. It was
badly scratched and bruised, and blood was flowing
from several wounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom reached under the torn coat and placed
his hand on the man’s heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still beating!” he exclaimed joyfully. “Not
very strongly, but he’s alive and he’s got a fighting
chance. Now, Ned, lend a hand and we’ll
get him down from here in a jiffy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That, however, was more easily said than done.
It was a difficult thing to release the body from
the twigs and branches that held the clothing.
Then, too, each of them could use only one hand
to support the weight of the body, while with
the other they must cling for support to the
branches. It was a task that taxed their strength
to the utmost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Luckily they were both stalwart and vigorous
and in superb physical condition, and the fearful
extremity in which their helpless burden lay called
into play the reserve strength that can usually be
depended on to meet a great emergency. Slowly
and painfully they made their tortuous way down
among the branches, until they rested on the lowest
bough, one that seemed strong enough to support
a regiment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They paused there a moment to take breath.
Jackson, in the meantime, had returned with a
stout coil of rope. He tossed one end of it up
to Tom. The latter caught it and made a loop
which he fastened securely under the arms of the
unconscious youth. Then, with Ned also holding
on, he slowly paid it out until the aviator
was within Jackson’s reach. The moment this
was done, Tom and Ned dropped to the ground,
and together they unfastened the rope and laid
the airman gently on the grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they did so, the youth gave a groan and
opened his eyes. He looked vacantly at the faces
above him and then drifted again into unconsciousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a brook at a little distance, and they
carried him to the bank. Then, while Ned and
Jackson bathed his face and wrists with the cool
water, Tom ran his hands over the body. He
had had a good deal of experience with accidents,
and this now stood him in stead. His face was
grave when he had finished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His right leg is broken, and a couple of ribs
as well,” he announced. “He may have internal
injuries also, but it will take a doctor to tell that.
Hand me over that first-aid kit and I’ll make a
splint for the leg. Then we’ll get him to the hospital
as soon as possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom worked skillfully and rapidly and soon
had the temporary splint in place. The pain involved
in setting the broken bone roused the
wounded aviator from his oblivion. Again he
opened his eyes, but this time there was less
of vacancy in them. He tried to speak, but
though his lips moved, no sound issued from
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom bent over him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve been hurt,” he said gently. “But
you’re with friends. If you tell us what your
name is and where you live we’ll try to get in
touch with your people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man muttered something that was
unintelligible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Try once more,” urged Tom kindly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a little louder tone and evidently with an
effort of will, the injured youth said something
that sounded like Hillobie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you say Hillobie?” asked Tom. “Just
nod your head, either yes or no. Don’t try to
speak.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the effort had been too much for the young
man’s feeble strength, and he closed his eyes and
lay motionless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll have to let it go at that,” said Tom,
rising to his feet. “Perhaps the hospital people
will find papers on him that will give a clue to
his identity. We’d better not wait to look for
any. Now let’s get him to the car.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span><h1>CHAPTER III<br/> <span class='sub-head'>AN ATTRACTIVE OFFER</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>With infinite</span> care the three rescuers carried
the injured airman to the car. They bestowed
him in it with some difficulty, owing to the limited
space, and then Tom took the wheel and
began to back out of the woods. There was no
room to turn around, and the process of getting
back to the road was slow and tedious. It was
fortunate that the man was unconscious, as otherwise
the jolting over the rough woods trail would
have been torture. But they reached the main
road at last, and then Tom made up for lost time
in a rapid spin to the doors of the hospital.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They carried the stranger in and gave a hurried
description of the accident to the physicians
in charge. Then they waited about until the doctors
had made a thorough examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll pull through,” announced Dr. Sherwood,
the head physician, at last. “But it’s a
lucky thing you fellows got to him just when you
did, or otherwise he would have soon died of
shock and exhaustion. As far as we can see
now, he has no internal injuries. The ribs and
leg are clean breaks and probably they’ll mend
without complications, though it’ll probably be a
couple of months before he can leave the hospital.
By the way, who set that leg bone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did,” replied Tom, in some alarm. “I hope
it was all right, Doctor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a nifty piece of work,” said the doctor,
with a smile. “Couldn’t have done it better
myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was anything found in his pockets that would
identify him?” asked Ned. “We thought he said
his name was Hillobie, but we couldn’t be quite
sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a thing,” replied the doctor. “If he’d
had any papers about him, they were shaken out
during his fall. Or they may have been burned
up with the plane. But probably some of his
relatives or friends will read of the accident and
communicate with us. I’ll let you know as soon
as I find out anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They thanked him and went out to the car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a lucky thing it was that I didn’t feel
like work this afternoon and went out for a spin
in the plane,” remarked Tom, as they sped toward
the Swift Construction plant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It sure was,” agreed Ned. “But don’t let it
become a habit,” he added, with a grin. “After
this, whenever you have an attack of spring
fever, I suppose you’ll make the virtuous excuse
that we’d better go out and see if there isn’t anybody
we can rescue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How well you size me up,” laughed Tom. “I
guess after this I’ll have to leave you to your
old figures while I sneak out alone. But here
we are at the plant. I’ll drop you and Jackson
here while I mosey along toward the house. I
want to get a bath and slip into some clean
clothes. I sure look like a hobo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You haven’t anything on us,” replied Ned, as
he looked somewhat ruefully at his torn and
rumpled clothes and his scratched hands, due to
their scramble through the branches. “But after
all,” he added, “it’s a cheap price to pay for having
saved that poor fellow’s life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom drove the roadster into its garage and
then made his way over to his house. This was
only a little distance away, as the plant had grown
up around the old homestead. For that reason,
it was not the most desirable location in the
world, but it had associations connected with it
that were precious and made Tom and his father
reluctant to abandon it. In the summer they had
a pleasant little cottage some distance away where
they spent much of their time, but for the greater
part of the year they lived in the old homestead.
One great thing in its favor was its proximity to
the plant, where Tom often worked until late in
the night when he was engrossed with a new invention.
Tom’s mother was dead and the household
was presided over by Mrs. Baggert, a
motherly, efficient woman, who handled all the
help and kept the home in perfect shape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Tom approached the gate, two figures came
hurrying forward to greet him. One was a
giant of a man, who had been brought home from
the jungles by Tom on one of his expeditions
abroad and who had become devotedly attached
to him. His strength was enormous and had
frequently stood Tom in good stead in moments
of peril. His native name had been Koku, and
this had been retained for want of a better. His
English was imperfect, though he could understand
anything that was said to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hobbling close behind him, and holding on to
his arm so that the giant should not be the first
to reach Tom, was an old negro who had been
in the household for years as a man of all work.
His name, of which he was inordinately proud
because of its mouth-filling qualities, was Eradicate
Sampson, which was usually shortened by
others to Rad. Tom was his idol, and the old
man would have died for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rad had not been at all pleased at first when
Koku was brought to the old homestead. He
feared that the giant might supplant him in the
affections of his young master. But gradually
this feeling had worn away, and he and the good-natured
giant had become close friends, although
there was a constant rivalry between them as to
who should serve Tom most and best.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doan you be in such a hurry, yo’ slamdacious
ole hunk o’ beef,” panted Rad. “Ah saw him
fust an’ it’s mah place to tell ’im. Marse Tom,
they’s——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Men to see you,” bellowed Koku, getting the
message out first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rad glared at him and was about to emit some
withering blast when he caught sight of Tom’s
scratched face and torn clothes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wha’s matter, Marse Tom?” he ejaculated.
“Been in fight or smash-up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me kill any one hurt him!” cried Koku.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m all right,” laughed Tom, who was
touched, however, by their evident concern.
“Just a few scratches and nothing else. Did you
say there’s somebody to see me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“T’ree men,” said Koku.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fo’ men,” corrected Rad, with a glance of
scorn. “Beats all how ignoramuses some folks
is. Yassah,” he went on, while Koku was temporarily
squelched, “Marse Damon’s dere wid
free udder gemmum an dey bin waitin’ some
time, sah.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Tom. “But I’ve got to slip
upstairs and get into other clothes. You go in,
Rad, and tell them I’ll be down in a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rad shambled off with a triumphant look at
Koku.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As for you, Koku,” said Tom to the giant,
who immediately brightened up, “you go down
to the garage and wash the roadster. I’ve had
a long ride in it this afternoon and it needs a
good cleaning. You’re the only one I’d trust to
do it right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Koku straightened up proudly and strode off.
Tom looked after him for a moment with an
amused smile and then slipped into the house by
the back way and went up to his room. He could
hear the voice of his eccentric friend, Wakefield
Damon, in the living room as he fumed about
and, as was his habit, blessed everything in sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Damon was a man much older than Tom,
but from the time he had let the lad have the
motor cycle that had nearly crushed out the man’s
life and had started Tom on his inventive career,
the two had been great friends. Mr. Damon
was as adventurous as a boy, and had accompanied
Tom on many wild trips to wilder parts
of the earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom washed and dressed hurriedly and then
went downstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my timepiece, Tom!” exclaimed Mr.
Damon, as the young man entered. “Where on
earth have you been? I’ve been ’phoning everywhere
I could think of for the last hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry,” replied Tom, as he shook hands with
his excitable friend and glanced at the three other
men in the room who had risen from their chairs.
“I was out for a ride in the airplane and was detained
longer than I expected.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my excuses!” said Mr. Damon. “Tom,
let me introduce these three gentlemen who have
called with me to see you on a matter of business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Damon introduced to Tom in turn a Mr.
Thompson, Mr. Bragden and Mr. Hankinshaw.
The two former were tall, sharp-eyed men, whose
every glance and movement indicated mental
celerity and familiarity with business. They
were immaculately dressed. Hankinshaw was
fat and gross, was roughly dressed and as uncouth
in his manners as he was in physical appearance.
He was smoking villainous tobacco
in a pipe at which he puffed incessantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, gentlemen,” said Tom pleasantly, after
the introductions had taken place and they had
resumed their seats, “what can I do for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We called,” said Mr. Thompson, who seemed
by common consent to be the spokesman of the
party, “to see you about the manufacture of some
special oil-drilling machinery. I happened to
know Mr. Damon slightly, due to the fact that
we have some investments in another line, and in
a conversation with him we told him something
about our project. He immediately suggested
that we get in communication with you. Said
you had the ability and facilities to make just
what we had in mind. Of course, the moment
he mentioned your name, we recognized it, for
who hasn’t heard of Tom Swift, the famous inventor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, there are lots of people who haven’t,”
said Tom. “I’ve knocked together a few little
things, but——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my modesty,” broke in Mr. Damon,
“listen to Tom talk. ‘Knocked together a few
little things!’ Why, he’s made airplanes and
cannon and searchlights and war tanks. He’s
dug tunnels and goodness knows what not.
Why, he’s made the whole tribe of inventors
look like a lot of also-rans! He’s run rings
around the lot of them. He’s the king pin.
He’s—he’s—” and here Mr. Damon, sputtering
incoherently, stopped for lack of breath and
glared reproachfully at Tom as he polished his
glasses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s evident that my reputation hasn’t suffered
at Mr. Damon’s hands,” laughed Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” put in Hankinshaw, with the faintest
sneer in his tone. “He makes a mighty good
press agent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thompson warned his colleague with a look,
and the latter subsided, puffing furiously at his
pipe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Swift doesn’t need any press agent,”
went on Thompson smoothly. “His inventions
speak for themselves. But now let us get down
to business. As I was saying——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon me while I call up my business manager,
Mr. Newton,” interrupted Tom. “I never
transact any important business without his presence
and advice. He’s over at the works, and
I’ll have him here in a minute.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span><h1>CHAPTER IV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>RECKLESS DRIVING</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The three</span> visitors exchanged glances. It was
evident that they did not especially welcome the
suggestion. Like many business men, they had
the idea that inventors were a sort of dreamy impractical
race, not keen at bargaining and easy to
beguile in a business deal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still they could not decently object to a thing
so obviously correct, and after a mere instant of
hesitation, Thompson made a virtue of necessity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We should be delighted,” he said suavely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom took up the telephone that rested on a
table near his hand and called up the plant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Newton,” he announced to the operator.
“Hello. That you, Ned? Come right over, will
you? I’m telephoning from the house. Some
gentlemen are here with a business proposition
and I want you here to confer with us. All
right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And while we’re about it,” remarked Tom,
as he put down the telephone, “I’ll have my father
in, if you don’t mind. He’s something of an invalid,
but he’ll be of great help in discussing the
proposition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thompson assented with the slightest touch of
vexation, immediately repressed, and Tom called
through the window to Rad to summon his
father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They talked on indifferent matters for a few
minutes until Mr. Swift and Ned arrived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Mr. Thompson,” said Tom, after introductions
had taken place and they had settled
back in their chairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As I stated,” resumed Thompson, “my partners
and I are interested in having some special
oil-well machinery manufactured. We have recently
returned from a trip to Texas, where we
have been investigating the oil situation. I can’t
be more specific just now as to the exact location
we have fixed upon for our venture for reasons
that you can easily understand. We do not
care to have any one know where it is, for although
we have secured a large number of leases
on property in the vicinity there are still more
that we are negotiating for, and we do not care
for competition. We think we have struck a
rich field. At any rate, we are confident enough
to make a try for it, although it involves a large
outlay of capital. We want to get the material
manufactured beforehand and shipped all at the
same time so that it will be only a matter of setting
up the machinery and starting the work. If
you can do the work within a stipulated time and
if your prices are right, we may be able to come
to an agreement. But we would want you to
cut your figures to the bone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can depend upon us treating you fairly
in the matter of price,” put in Tom, and Ned
nodded assent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here,” said Thompson, taking up several
sheets covered with figures and diagrams, “are
the specifications of what we think we shall need;
tubing, casings, drills, bits and the rest. They
differ in some respects from those commonly in
use, but we think they represent the most up-to-date
inventions and improvements.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” put in Bragden, “if in the course
of their manufacture you can improve on them
we shall be glad to have you do so. Any new
idea that comes to you we shall welcome. But,
of course, that will not affect the conditions of
the contract we may make with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes it will,” said Tom drily. “Our contract
will cover only the manufacture in exact
conformity to the stipulations. If I invent anything
better, the invention will belong to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see why,” growled Hankinshaw. “It
seems to me that all your brains and time belong
to us while you are working on the contract.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His tone and manner were offensive, but Tom
restrained his resentment and answered quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re mistaken there,” he replied. “You
will see that if you look up the law on patents.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right,” said Thompson soothingly.
“What we are especially interested in now is the
time in which you can do this and the figure at
which you can do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think we can satisfy you in both particulars,”
replied Tom, as he looked over the plans.
“We have the plant and the machinery for turning
out all the implements you have down here.
But, of course, in a thing of this kind we can’t
answer offhand. We’ll have to figure out labor
and material costs, overhead and other items before
we can name a definite figure. Suppose you
leave these papers with us, and by to-morrow
night we’ll be prepared to give you our terms.
How will that do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s satisfactory,” replied Mr. Thompson,
after a moment’s conference with his colleagues.
“Shall we see you here or at our hotel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps we’d better meet in the office of the
plant,” suggested Tom. “Then we can show you
over the factory and let you get an idea of our
facilities.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good idea,” assented Thompson, and, rising,
he and his companions took their departure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my bank account!” exclaimed Mr.
Damon, after the visitors had gone. “I think
I’ve let you in for a good thing, Tom, my boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may be so,” replied Tom reflectively, “and
I’m very much obliged to you. By the way, Mr.
Damon, what do you know about these men?
Are they straight? Are they financially reliable?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my responsibility!” was the reply. “As
far as I know they’re all right. Thompson is
the only one I know, and that but slightly; but
my impression is that he has slathers of money.
They’ve got to have some money or they wouldn’t
be able to lease those oil lands they were telling
us about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, that doesn’t mean such an outlay
as it may seem on the surface,” said Ned thoughtfully.
“They can lease all the farmland they
want at a dollar an acre. The farmer is perfectly
willing to let it go for that, for he wins any way.
If oil isn’t found on his land he still has his
property, and the dollar an acre is pure velvet.
If it is found, he is allowed by law a royalty of
one-eighth of the profit from the well or wells.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you come to know so much about it?”
asked Tom, in some surprise. “I thought that
your head was so full of figures that you didn’t
have much time for anything else. Haven’t been
investing in oil stocks, have you?” he added
laughingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not exactly,” answered Ned. “But you can’t
take up the papers nowadays without finding a
lot about oil in them. There was a time when
cotton was king. A little later steel was king.
But to-day oil is king. Who’s the richest man in
the world to-day? An oil man. What’s at the
bottom of half the squabbles between nations
nowadays? The fight for the possession of oil
fields. England wants control of the oil fields
in Persia and Mesopotamia. The Dutch are
shutting out all foreigners from the Djambi fields.
Soviet Russia expects to get enough money from
her oil-well concessions to run the Government.
So it goes all over the world. Oil is king. Look
at the demand for it. See how automobiles are
being manufactured by the millions. See how
it has taken the place of coal for fuel in our own
battleships and the great ocean liners. See how
the great office buildings in various cities are
using it in place of coal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s millions in it, eh?” laughed Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Billions, trillions,” corrected Ned. “But now
let’s get down to brass tacks and look over these
specifications. Something tells me that we’ve
got to watch our step in dealing with these men.
Of course, they may be all right at that, but——”
and he left his sentence unfinished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care much for that fellow Hankinshaw
for a fact,” remarked Tom. “Once or
twice I’d have liked to throw him out of the
room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He a little bit more than annoyed me, too,”
assented Ned. “I wish he’d get another brand
of tobacco.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my appetite!” remarked Mr. Damon, as
he looked at his watch. “I’ll be late for dinner
and let myself in for a scolding. So long, folks,”
and with a hurried handshake he was off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Left to themselves, Tom, his father, and Ned
put their heads together in close study of the
specifications for the oil-well machinery. Although
Mr. Swift had not been physically strong
for years, his mind was as keen as ever and he
was of invaluable service to the others, both of
whom valued his opinion highly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sat long in conference, which was interrupted
by dinner, to which Ned stayed. After
the meal another hour of discussion ensued, at
the end of which they had a pretty clear idea of
the terms they would offer to the oil prospectors.
There were some details left for Ned to look
up on the following day, including an investigation
as to the financial standing of the oil men,
but the main features of their offer were practically
settled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s that,” remarked Tom, as Ned
rose to go. “Wait a minute, Ned, and I’ll get
out the car and drop you at your house. I’m
going up your way, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Ned drily, as he looked out of the
window. “I notice that it’s a beautiful moonlight
night. And I remember that Mary Nestor
lives on the same street just a little way beyond
our house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What an acute mind you have,” laughed Tom.
“I’d hate to have you on my trail if I’d committed
a crime. Come along now and don’t be
envious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is possible that Mary Nestor had noticed too
that it was a beautiful moonlight night and barely
possible that the thought had occurred to her
that a certain young inventor might happen along
that way. What is certain is that she was
dressed most becomingly, that her cheeks had a
pink flush in them, and that her eyes were uncommonly
bright as she opened the door in response
to his ring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Tom, what a pleasant surprise,” she
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s too fine a night to be indoors, Mary,”
said Tom, as he held her hand a little longer than
was absolutely necessary. “What do you say to
a spin along the lake road? Just for an hour
or so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be glad to,” answered Mary. “Come
into the living room and see father and mother
for a moment while I get my hat on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She ushered him into the room and then ran
upstairs while Tom greeted her parents. He was
a great favorite with them, and they welcomed
him warmly. They chatted together for a few
minutes until Mary came down. Then, with a
promise not to be gone too long, the young people
went out to the car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moonlight flooded the roads, making them
almost as bright as in the day. There was just
a light breeze that blew little wisps of hair about
Mary’s face in a way that made her seem more
bewitching than ever. It was a night when it
was good to be young and to be alive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On such a night——” murmured Tom, as the
car purred smoothly along.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going to quote Shakespeare?” inquired Mary
mischievously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not exactly,” laughed Tom. “Mary,” he
said, “listen. I——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But what he wanted Mary to listen to could
not be told at the moment, for just then a big
touring car came plunging around a bend in the
road and came tearing down toward them.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span><h1>CHAPTER V<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A CLOSE SHAVE</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The big</span> machine came thundering along at a
reckless pace, not attempting to keep to the right,
but holding to the middle of the road. At the
same time Tom and Mary could hear the sound
of boisterous singing from the people in the car.
It was evidently a party out for a “joy ride” and
totally careless of the rights of others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a cry of fright from Mary as the
car kept on its course as if determined to ride
them down. Tom turned the wheel sharply, so
sharply in fact that his car went into a little ditch
at the side of the road. At the same instant the
bigger machine whizzed past, the driver grinning
at the way he had crowded the other car off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom was boiling over with indignation. If
he had not had Mary with him, he would have
turned and pursued the other car and never
stopped until he had thrashed the driver or landed
him in jail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The scoundrel!” he cried. “That fellow was
little better than a murderer. If I could lay my
hands on him I’d make him sorry that he’d ever
been born.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, there, Tom,” said Mary soothingly,
though she was still trembling. “Let’s be thankful
we’re alive. If you hadn’t been as quick as
you were we would both have been killed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It took a few minutes and considerable maneuvering
to get the car out of the ditch, but at last
they were on the road again, and under the influence
of Mary’s presence, Tom’s wrath finally
simmered down. After all, they were, safe and
together and nothing else mattered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t know what a change has taken
place in our home since father came back from
that foreign trip,” remarked Mary. “It’s like a
different place. He is so much improved and
more cheerful that it seems as if a ton’s weight
had been removed from our hearts. Mother goes
about her work singing, and as for myself I’m
happy beyond words.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That cranky old doctor knew his business,
though it was like drawing teeth to get him to
examine your father,” replied Tom. “It was an
inspiration to send him abroad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It might have been inspiration that sent him,
but it took a young inventor named Tom Swift
to bring him back,” said Mary. “I shudder yet
to think of what might have happened if it hadn’t
been for your courage and daring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that was nothing,” answered Tom.
“Any one else could have done the same if they’d
had my facilities. I just happened to own an
airplane that could do anything one asked of it.
And the old bus certainly did herself proud.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The old bus, as you call it, wouldn’t have done
anything if it hadn’t been for its pilot,” asserted
Mary. “Everybody knows that. But you’re so
painfully modest that I suppose you’d never own
up to it, any more than you’d own up to what
you did to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did I do to-day?” parried Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, nothing,” laughed Mary. “Only saved a
man from dying. Only set a broken leg as skillfully
as a surgeon could do it. Apart from little
trifles like that you didn’t do anything. I’d like
to know what you would call a really good day’s
work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ned Newton and Garret Jackson had as much
to do with that as I did, Mary. But how did you
come to hear about it, anyway?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dr. Sherwood dropped in to see father early
this evening,” was the answer. “You know
they’re old friends. He thinks you ought to be
a doctor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess I’ll stick to invention and manufacturing
for a while yet,” answered Tom, grinning.
“Especially as I’m up to my neck in business.
Everything’s humming down at the works. New
contract came in to-day. At least I think it will
be a contract if we can come to terms on prices.
Going to give my answer to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me about it,” urged Mary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s for the making of some oil-well machinery,”
answered Tom. “It’s something new
for us, but we’ve got the facilities and can manage
it all right. Mr. Damon brought the men
to us, and I think it may result in a pretty big
deal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if they were the men I saw in Mr.
Damon’s car when they passed our house to-day,”
said Mary, with heightened interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Likely enough,” answered Tom carelessly.
“There were three of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two tall ones and one fat stodgy one?” asked
Mary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right,” replied Tom. “But why the
sudden interest? Do you happen to know any
of them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary did not answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom looked at her in some surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you hear my question?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know any of them,” answered Mary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was something in her tone that piqued
Tom’s curiosity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, Mary, out with it,” he urged. “You’re
concealing something. Let me know what it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry I spoke,” said Mary reluctantly,
“I was right when I said that I didn’t know any
of them. But one of them spoke to me in town
to-day and tried to strike up an acquaintance.
Of course, I froze him and got away from him
as fast as I could.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The hound!” cried Tom furiously. “Which
one of them was it? I’ll have his hide!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was the fat, coarse one,” replied Mary. “I
don’t know his name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hankinshaw!” cried Tom. “The low brute!
Just wait till I can lay my hands on him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Tom, you must promise me not to do
anything rash,” pleaded Mary, laying her hand
on his arm. “There’s been no real harm done,
and I squelched him so hard that I guess he’ll
never annoy me again. It would only give me
unpleasant publicity if you attempted to punish
him. And then, too, I don’t want anything to
be done that may interfere with your business
deal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you suppose I care for the business
deal?” exclaimed Tom. “If that were the only
thing concerned, I’d go to him and thrash him
within an inch of his life. I disliked the fellow
from the minute I saw him, anyway, and if I’d
known what I know now I’d have bundled him
out of the house neck and heels.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I’d held my tongue,” sighed the girl.
“But don’t you see, Tom, that if you did anything
now it would hurt me more than any one
else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom did see, and reluctantly relinquished his
desire to inflict summary punishment on the fellow,
though he fumed inwardly and vowed to
himself that he would keep a close watch on the
cad during the rest of his stay in Shopton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly a thought struck him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know,” he said, “that speaking of
that rascal has reminded me of something?
When that road hog nearly crashed into us just
now, I thought there was something familiar in
his face, but I couldn’t just place him. Now I
think I know. I’ll bet it was Hankinshaw.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shouldn’t wonder,” replied Mary. “I was
so frightened that I couldn’t be sure, but in the
glimpse I got of that repulsive face there seemed
to be something I had seen before. I believe
you’re right. He’s just the type of man to do
that sort of thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Another thing added to his account,” said
Tom grimly. “Something tells me that some
day Mr. Hankinshaw and I will have a reckoning.
And it won’t be exactly a pleasant day for
him either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, let’s talk of something more pleasant,”
said Mary, trying to get the young inventor
out of his angry mood. “Do you know, Tom, I
was greatly interested when you spoke about oil?
It seems to me to be about the most important
thing in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Funny,” replied Tom. “That’s just what
Ned Newton was saying to-day. I’ve been so
busy with my inventions that I haven’t paid much
attention to it myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shouldn’t wonder if you would find that
one of the most profitable things to devote your
inventive genius to,” was the answer. “Father
was saying the other day that there wasn’t a
thing hardly with which oil wasn’t connected in
some way or other. This car in which we are
riding couldn’t run without oil and couldn’t be
driven without gasoline. The same is true of the
airplane in which you were flying this afternoon.
Even on the farm the tractors are being driven
by it. We women wouldn’t know what to do
without naphtha and gasoline to remove spots.
It’s in everything from the smallest to the biggest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Almost thou persuadest me,” laughed Tom.
“At any rate, I’m going to make a thorough
study of the subject, and perhaps I may hit on
something that will be worth while in the way
of invention.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure you will,” replied Mary warmly.
“You never yet have gone at a thing with all your
heart but what you have succeeded in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had a delightful ride, despite the unpleasant
feature that had intruded upon it at the
start, and Tom had to let out his car to the fullest
speed to get Mary back home at the time he
had promised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day was a busy one at the Swift Construction
works. Tom was buried deep in the
technical details of the machinery, and his father
helped greatly with his assistance and advice.
Already ideas of improvements were thronging
in Tom’s active mind and he grew more and more
interested as his study progressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned, too, was active in preparing his figures
and estimates. He had been busy with the telegraph
inquiring into the financial standing and
responsibility of the oil men, and while these
were not absolutely satisfactory, they were sufficiently
good to warrant taking a reasonable
chance, though they indicated the need of caution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Late in the afternoon Tom and Ned came together
for a preliminary conference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, how goes the battle, Ned?” asked Tom,
as he settled into his office chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got everything ready,” replied Ned, as he
pointed to a mass of papers on his desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!” was the reply. “As regards the time
limit,” went on Tom, “I’ve consulted with Jackson
and we figure that we can complete the job
in six weeks. Of course, we could do it sooner,
if we put the whole force on it, but we’ve got to
take care of the contracts we have on hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As regards the price, we can do it at a fair
profit for twenty-six thousand dollars,” said the
financial man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think they’re good for it?” asked
Tom thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think we can take a chance,” answered Ned.
“The references weren’t exactly what you could
tall gilt-edged, but as regards Thompson and
Bragden, they were fairly good. As to Hankinshaw——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The skunk!” muttered Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that?” asked Ned, looking up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing,” answered Tom. “I was just
thinking out loud. Go ahead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As to Hankinshaw,” Ned went on, “replies
weren’t so good. He seems to have been mixed
up in some shady deals. Went bankrupt once
under suspicious circumstances. But he seems
to be a minor figure in the deal. Thompson
seems to be the king pin. To make things safer,
however, we’ll demand a substantial cash payment
on the signing of the contract and other
payments while the work is in progress. That
will cover us as we go along, and we can’t be
stung to any extent. Take it altogether, my advice
is that we conclude the deal, if they agree
to our stipulations. And I think they will, for
they’ve doubtless figured the matter out and
they’ll know that our figures are right. Of
course, they’ll try to reduce them, but we’ll stand
pat. That is, of course, if you agree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll leave that all to you, Ned,” replied Tom.
“Anything that you say goes. They can take it
or leave it at our figures.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span><h1>CHAPTER VI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Gemmun to</span> see you, sah.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With his very best bow, Rad ushered the three
men into the office of the Swift works that evening,
where Tom, his father, and Ned were waiting
to receive them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, Koku,” Rad had said patronizingly,
when he had been directed by Tom to be at the
office in case he were needed for any errands,
“Marse Tom knows who to count on when he
wants anything what takes ’telligence. Yo’s all
right when it comes to muscle, but when brains
is needed yo’s certainly not dar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could break your back like that,” glowered
Koku, snapping his fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sho, sho,” agreed Rad hurriedly, retreating
a little. “So cud a g’rilla. But what brains has
a g’rilla got? Huh. Nuffin at all. Et’s brains,
Koku, brains whut counts, I’m tellin’ you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom, who had overheard the controversy, mollified
the giant by directing him to watch over
the visitors’ car and see that no one got away
with it, and peace was reëstablished for the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The visitors offered to shake hands. Tom
thus greeted Thompson and Bragden, but when
Hankinshaw also held out his hand Tom was
very busy with some papers and did not seem to
see it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Thompson, when cigars had been
lighted, though Hankinshaw clung to his malodorous
pipe, “how about those figures? Let’s
know the worst. You’ll remember what I said
about cutting them to the bone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There wouldn’t be much nourishment for us
if we didn’t leave some meat on them,” remarked
Tom, with a smile; “but we’ve cut as close as we
can and yet leave ourselves a reasonable profit.
Mr. Newton has the figures. Go ahead, Ned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned handed to each of the three men a duplicate
sheet of the proposed contract.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those are our figures,” he said. “As you
see, we make the total sum twenty-six thousand
dollars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty-six thousand dollars!” exclaimed
Thompson, with a well simulated start of surprise,
while Bragden held up his hands as though
calling on heaven to witness the outrageous price.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the figure,” said Ned firmly, “and if
you’ve done any calculating at all you must know,
that they are reasonable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Looks as though you were trying to bleed us
white,” growled Hankinshaw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We don’t bleed anybody,” put in Tom coldly.
“Our reputation in the trade is too valuable for
us to indulge in any such tactics.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think that twenty thousand dollars
would have been the extreme outside price,” objected
Thompson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can’t go below our figures,” said Ned.
“Our first price is our best and our only price.
That’s the fixed policy of the Company.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you say to splitting the difference
and making it twenty-three thousand?” suggested
Bragden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty-six thousand stands,” he said. “Of
course, you’re under no obligation to accept these
terms if you think they’re too high. But that’s
the best we can do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You gentlemen may wish to talk the matter
over among yourselves,” suggested Tom. “If
so, you can step into the adjoining office where
you’ll have privacy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The visitors filed off into the other room where
an animated conversation ensued. Thompson
and Bragden kept their voices lowered, but every
now and then Hankinshaw could be heard growling
and objurgating, while his partners tried to
quiet him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a little while they returned and resumed
their seats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We still think the figures are too high,”
Thompson announced; “but in view of your unyielding
attitude and the fact that we are in a
hurry to get to work, we have decided reluctantly
to accept them. As to the time limit, six weeks
perhaps will be all right, provided we can depend
on the material being ready at that time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’ll be ready on the dot,” Tom assured him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, your figures include delivery at the
station in Texas that we shall designate,” Thompson
went on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all,” replied Ned. “If you will look
at your contract again, you will see that it is
clearly stated that those prices are f. o. b. Shopton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Scalping us like regular Indians,” snarled
Hankinshaw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thompson silenced him with a look. A long
debate ensued, which ended with Ned’s carrying
his point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now there’s one other point,” said Thompson.
“How about this proviso that five thousand
of the amount shall be paid down on the
signing of the contract? It doesn’t seem to me
that that is necessary or usual.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s usual enough in an affair of this size,”
replied Ned. “It’s only a matter of prudence or
self-protection. You must realize, Mr. Thompson,
that our acquaintance has been of very short
duration and that we have never done business
with you before. We have no doubt, of course,
that everything is all right. There is nothing
personal in this. It is just a matter of ordinary
business precaution and procedure. This is a
new line of work for us, and we shall have to incur
a large initial expense for new tools that we
have not hitherto required. Under the circumstances,
therefore, we shall have to require that
five thousand be paid down on the signing of the
contract, five thousand more two weeks from
now, five thousand four weeks from now and
the balance on completion of the work. If you
were building a house you would have to make
some arrangement of the kind. We are asking
nothing more of you than we do of others who
are doing business with us for the first time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think that Mr. Damon’s recommendation
would have been sufficient,” grumbled
Hankinshaw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Damon’s acquaintance was limited to Mr.
Thompson, and I gathered was not very intimate,”
replied Ned. “I guess we’ll have to leave
him out of this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hankinshaw was for continuing the argument,
but the more astute Thompson, who saw that extended
controversy on this point was liable to
convey the impression that their financial responsibility
was not what it should be, yielded the
point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You certainly are a hard-boiled lot,” he said,
with an attempt at jocularity. “But I guess you
have us where you want us and that we’ll have
to sign on the dotted line. That is,” he added,
looking at his companions, “if my partners
agree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They nodded, Bragden reluctantly and Hankinshaw
scowlingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom and his father affixed their signatures,
which were followed by those of the three
visitors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, now that that’s settled,” remarked
Thompson, as he rose from his chair, “I guess
we’ll have to be getting along. Mr. Bragden and
I have to get the night train. Mr. Hankinshaw
will stay here for a while to take care of our interests
and keep an eye on the work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just a moment,” put in Ned. “That matter
of the initial check for five thousand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” said Thompson. “How careless of
me to overlook that. If you’ll hand me that pen,
I’ll fix it up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took out a checkbook and wrote a check
for five thousand dollars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There you are,” he said, handing it to Ned
with a flourish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned scanned it closely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The amount is all right,” he said, after an
instant, “but the date is wrong. You’ve got it
the 27th of May, while this is only the 21st.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure enough,” replied Thompson, with an air
of vexation, as he looked at it. “I made it the
21st, but there must have been a hair on the pen
and that made it a seven. Tear that one up and
I’ll make you out another. And this time I’ll
see that the pen is clean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rubbed the pen carefully and made out another
check that was correct. Ned examined it,
folded it and put it in his pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The receipt of this is already acknowledged
in the contract,” he reminded Thompson, and the
latter nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The visitors said good-night and took their
leave, Rad opening the door for them with a profound
bow that put such a crick in his back that
he had hard work straightening up again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Ned,” said Tom, “I have to hand it to
you for the way you carried your points. You’re
all wool and a yard wide as a business man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You surely are, Ned,” agreed Tom’s father
warmly. “You and Tom make a good team, he
for the inventive and you for the financial end
of the business. But now, as I’m pretty tired, I
guess I’ll go over to the house and take Rad
along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Dad,” said Tom. “I’ll be over before
long. Hope you’ll get a good night’s sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall if that tooth will let me,” and Mr.
Swift smiled faintly. He had been having a
great deal of trouble with his teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better see a dentist in the morning and have
it out if it doesn’t behave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess that is what I’ll have to do, Tom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tom, the next thing for you to invent will
be a painless tooth-pulling machine,” remarked
Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sounds fine,” returned Mr. Swift, with a
smile, and then passed out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Left alone, the young men looked at each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the level now, Ned, what do you think of
those birds?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should call them eels instead of birds,” replied
Ned. “They strike me as being just about
as slippery as they come. It was all right, of
course, trying to get better terms. That was just
what any business men would do. But that
matter of the check looked fishy to me. In the
first place, he didn’t forget about it as he pretended
to do. Men don’t forget a thing like
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you suppose his idea was?” asked
Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just to get out of reach before we thought,
of it. Then perhaps he thought that we’d go on
with the work anyway so as to lose no time, since
we’ve got to get it through in six weeks. We’d
have to correspond with him about it, and he
could palter and delay until we’d got so far along
with the work that we’d go on with it anyway.
And then when I nailed him down to it, did you
see how he post-dated the check? Hair on the
pen! Tell that to the marines. The idea was to
make the check no good until nearly a week had
passed. That would keep their money in the
bank a week longer, or if they haven’t got the
money now to meet it, they’d have a week to get
the funds together to meet it when presented.
They may be operating on a shoestring, anyway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, too, the check is on a San Francisco
bank. That may be all right, but in the natural
course of exchange it will take nearly a week to
collect it. There again we’d be supposed to be
well on our way with the work, so far in fact
that we couldn’t back out. But they’ll get slipped
up if they’re trying any funny business there, for
I’ll telegraph the first thing to-morrow morning
to find out whether the check is good, and you’d
better not do a stroke of work on the contract
until we’re sure it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m almost sorry we’ve undertaken the
work,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not,” replied Ned. “Of course, it’s much
more comfortable to feel that we’re dealing with
perfectly responsible people, but we’ve got the
thing sewed up so that we can’t lose, anyway.
They might like to cheat us, but they can’t. In
the first place, we won’t spend a penny until we’re
absolutely sure of five thousand dollars. That
will cover everything until the next payment
comes due two weeks from now. If they renege
then, we’ll stop and be money in pocket. If they
pay, we’ll have received ten thousand dollars.
The payments after that they’ll have to make,
anyway, for they will already have paid more
than they can afford to lose. We’ve got them
every way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, too, we’ve got a nice little profit in this
proposition. It may also open up a new line that
will be big in possibilities. You know already
what I think of oil. The demand already for
oil-well machinery is greater than the supply, and
I know of some factories that are running three
shifts and working the whole twenty-four hours
to keep up with their orders. With the new oil
fields that are being opened up, that demand is
bound to increase, and there’s no reason why we
shouldn’t get our share of the business. This
first order will perhaps set us on the road to doing
this. Then, too, I’m banking on your inventing
something new that will be so good that
every oil field will have to have it. You’ve never
tackled anything yet that you haven’t improved
upon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks for the bouquet,” said Tom, grinning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No bouquet at all,” answered Ned. “It’s the
simple truth, and you know it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Tom, “I’ll do my best. I feel
the old urge coming on, and I’m hankering to
get at it. There’s just one thing that’s bothering
me now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that?” asked Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hankinshaw,” replied Tom.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span><h1>CHAPTER VII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>TROUBLE BREWING</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Ned stopped</span> in his work of gathering up his
papers and looked inquiringly at Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hankinshaw!” he repeated. “What about
him? What have you got against him outside of
his smoking vile tobacco?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A good deal,” answered Tom emphatically.
“He’s just about as popular with me as a rattlesnake
at a picnic party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why the snake?” asked Ned quizzically.
“I’m not much of an authority on natural history,
but I’d call him an old crab and let it go
at that. What has he done especially that peeves
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Several things,” replied Tom, who did not
care to mention Mary’s name and tell of the annoyance
she had experienced. “For one thing,
I’m pretty sure that he was driving a machine
last night that nearly sent me to kingdom come.
Hogged the road and made me go into a ditch.
Then grinned like a gargoyle as he whizzed past.
I tell you for a minute I saw red, and it’s a lucky
thing for him that I didn’t get my hands on
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I imagine that’s the type of fellow he is,”
said Ned. “I don’t wonder that you felt like
beating him up. Sorry that Thompson or Bragden
didn’t stop over to look after the work instead
of him. They may be no better than he
is at heart, but at least they have the manners of
gentlemen. But, after all, it will be for only a
few weeks, and we’ll try to make the best of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day Ned telegraphed to the California
bank, and to his satisfaction learned that the
check was good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right,” he told Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’ll go ahead,” said the young inventor.
“I’ll start in right away and order the material
we need, and I’ll get busy gathering all the
information on oil-well machinery and trying to
improve on it. No more car rides or airplane
spins, or anything else, for a while. Here’s
where I shed my coat and work night and day.
Watch my smoke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next week was one of intense energy and
application for the young inventor. He had the
gift of losing himself in his work, especially
when that work interested him. And the further
he went into the subject the greater the grip it
got upon him. His enthusiasm grew as he
plunged into the fascinating study of the tremendous
riches in oil that the earth held beneath
its surface. Soon he was absorbed in it as in a
thrilling romance. He traced the gradual steps
by which men of all climes and in all ages had
sought to possess themselves of this marvelous
wealth stored in nature’s caverns and only yielded
up reluctantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know,” he said one night to Ned, as
they sat discussing the matter in the office, “that
the Chinese were the pioneers in the matter of oil-well
digging?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I didn’t,” replied Ned. “But I’m not
surprised. Those old Chinamen seem to have
started most of the things we’ve improved on
later. There’s gunpowder and the compass and
a raft of other things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, digging for oil was one of them,” said
Tom. “And the principles they applied underlie
the methods we’re using to-day. Of course, they
didn’t use steam power, and that’s where we’ve
got the bulge on them. They worked by man
power, and that apparatus was laughably crude
when compared with ours, yet their methods were
strikingly similar to those we’re using now or
have been using very recently.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For instance?” said Ned, with a lifting of the
eyebrows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, take their springboard arrangement,”
replied Tom. “The cutting tool, or bit, was suspended
in the hole by means of a rattan cable,
and the required movement was given to it by a
springboard. When a coolie jumped on the
board, it raised the bit; when he relieved it of
his weight the bit fell and cut its way downward.
A drum with a vertical shaft, around which oxen
traveled in a circle, coiled the cable and lifted
the drill out of the hole when they wanted to
bail out the hole or change tools. The bailer was
made of a section of bamboo, and that material
was also used for tubing and casing and pipe
lines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, this springboard was very similar in
action and function to the springpole which we’ve
used here in America, chiefly at first for drilling
brine wells. It was used, too, in drilling the
first oil well of the California fields.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they’ve given that up now, haven’t they?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure they have,” was the answer. “The
walking beam, which is the biggest piece of timber
in the present-day drilling rig, has taken its
place. And, of course, that’s now operated by
steam instead of manual labor. But my point
is that the old springboard process of the Chinese
and the springpole method that we’ve used till
recently are fundamentally based on the same
thing—the percussion process.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve got a long way from that now, I imagine,”
remarked Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have and we haven’t,” replied Tom.
“Percussion is still in common use in a great
many wells, especially when they’re not supposed
to go very deep and where the rocks are of comparatively
soft stone. But where these conditions
don’t exist, the rotary method is often employed.
In that case two strings of pipe are
used, one to wall up the hole, while the other
with the drill attached is rotated inside of it. An
important thing in connection with this method is
that a circulation of thick mud pumped through
the drill stem will support the walls of the hole
until the well is completed, provided it isn’t too
deep. It’s being used a lot now in the Texas
fields, and I’m looking into it thoroughly. I tell
you, old boy, it’s a fascinating study.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the way I like to hear you talk,” said
Ned, with a smile. “Once you get interested in
a thing, you’ll never stop until you improve on
it. I’ll bet a year’s salary that before a month’s
over, you’ll have invented something that will
set the country talking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t risk your money so recklessly,” laughed
Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not rash,” replied Ned. “As a matter
of fact, such a wager wouldn’t be sportsmanlike,
for I’d be betting on a sure thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although Tom’s time had been taken up so
fully day and night with the contract he had on
hand and the new invention he was evolving, he
had not forgotten or neglected the unfortunate
airman whom he and his friends had saved from
death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several times each week he called up the hospital
by telephone to learn how the patient was
progressing. And he had requested Mrs. Baggert,
the housekeeper of the Swift home, to send
fruit, jellies and other delicacies to the sufferer,
a task which that warm-hearted woman undertook
gladly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come along, Ned,” said Tom one afternoon.
“Let’s jump into the roadster and go up to the
hospital. I want to see for myself how the poor
fellow is getting along. Those ’phone calls are
usually answered by the secretary, and she’s
rather hazy in her reports. I want to have a
talk with Doctor Sherwood himself. Nothing
like going right to headquarters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned looked rather dubiously at a pile of papers
on his desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to,” he said, “but——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom laughed, picked up Ned’s hat, jammed it
on his friend’s head, and yanked him out of his
office chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got such winning ways, I can’t resist
you,” observed Ned, surrendering with a grin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few minutes they were at the hospital. In
the hall they met Dr. Sherwood, who was just
coming out of one of the wards. He greeted
them heartily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can guess what you’ve come for,” he remarked.
“I wish I had more cheerful news for
you about that poor fellow you brought here.
But it’s proved to be a more serious case than I
thought at first it would be. The fractured leg
is mending all right, but his head’s in a bad
way. It’s a case of brain concussion. He
must have hit his head pretty hard when he
dived into the tree. Most of the time he’s unconscious
or semi-conscious, and his temperature
stays high.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t think he’ll die, do you?” asked
Tom anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No-o,” replied the doctor slowly, “I hardly
think so. Still, you can’t tell. He’s a mighty
sick man. But come along with me and you can
see him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They followed him on tiptoe into one of the
rooms. But they did not need to be so careful,
for the young man with flushed face and disordered
hair who lay on the cot was wholly
oblivious to their presence. He was babbling in
delirium, and there was no intelligence in the
eyes whose restless glances passed over the visitors
as though they were not there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a saddening sight, and as the boys could
be of no service they quickly took their leave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No clue to his identity yet?” asked Tom of
the doctor, who had accompanied them out on
the steps of the hospital.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” was the reply. “Lots of people have
looked at him without recognizing him. We’ve
had many letters from all parts of the country
from people who had read of the accident and
thought the young fellow might be a missing son
or some other relative. But he doesn’t answer
to any of the descriptions given. And he himself
hasn’t been in a condition to tell us who
he is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That young fellow certainly got a rough
deal,” remarked Ned, as he and Tom walked
away. “Think of his suffering like that and being
all alone—I mean as far as his folks are
concerned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Ned, and think of his folks, if he has
any. How they must be worrying about him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Queer he didn’t have some sort of tag on his
clothing. Most aviators wear them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So they do. But fellows get careless. I
suppose he forgot all about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next week was a busy one for Tom. During
the evenings he was engrossed in the study
of everything he could find that bore in the most
remote degree on the subject of oil and oil wells.
He had already a very extensive scientific and
mechanical library, but in addition he wrote and
wired to learned societies and Government bureaus
for their latest bulletins and reports. These
were soon coming in to him by every mail, and
he devoured them with an insatiable appetite.
Any one looking over from the house could see
the light burning in his office till long after midnight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And every night when Tom at last put out
the light and stepped outside, he saw either a very
slight or a very massive figure waiting to accompany
him over the short distance that lay between
the office and the house. One night it would be
Rad and the next night Koku. Those two had
had many wrangles on the subject of who should
guard their idolized master, and had finally compromised
on taking turns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom at first had laughed and then scolded, but
to no purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You nebber kin tell, Marse Tom,” Rad had
said, shaking his woolly head, when Tom remonstrated
with him, “w’en somebuddy might cum
nosin’ an spifflicatin’ roun’ here w’en you’s busy
wid yo’ wuk; an’ ef dey does, dey’s goin’ to fin’
’Radicate Sampson right on de job. Nussah,
nussah, Marse Tom, dey ain’t no use argifyin’.
Ah stays heah while you stays heah.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Koku was less voluble, but no less devoted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me sleep when you sleep,” he said simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Faced with such loyalty, Tom could do nothing
but surrender.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The days were no less busy than the nights,
though in another way. Tom spent hours with
Garret Jackson, the manager of the mechanical
department of the works. He was a first-class
mechanic, clear-headed and forward looking, and
had been with the Swift Construction Company
for years. Tom had not only the greatest respect
for his ability, but also implicit confidence
in his discretion. Again and again it had been
necessary for Tom to entrust him with secrets
of his inventions while he was having special machinery
made, and he had never betrayed his trust.
Repeatedly Tom thanked his stars that he had
two such faithful coworkers as Ned Newton in
the financial end and Garret Jackson in the mechanical
part of his business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a result of his conferences with Jackson, it
was not long before a high fence began to be
constructed in a rather remote section of the
plant. Many curious glances were cast at it as
it went up, enclosing an area of about a hundred
feet square. What it was intended for only a
few knew, and the cold stare of Jackson when
any one hinted at a question soon discouraged the
inquisitive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was just verging on dusk one night, when
Tom, coming back from the post-office, passed
the one large confectionery store which the town
of Shopton possessed. He glanced carelessly
through the window and saw that the store contained
two customers, a man and a girl. The
latter, who was a trifle out of the direct line of
Tom’s vision, was edging away from the man,
who seemed to be annoying her. The man followed
and laid his hand on her arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl threw it off and faced him indignantly.
As she did so, Tom saw that it was Mary!</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a flash he was in the store.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span><h1>CHAPTER VIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THROUGH THE WINDOW</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Tom, having</span> so suddenly burst into the store,
grabbed the man by the collar and whirled him
about so that the two were face to face. It was
Hankinshaw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean by that?” sputtered Hankinshaw,
as he tried to wrench himself loose
from the strangle hold that Tom had on him,
his face fairly apoplectic with rage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s up to me to ask you what you mean by
daring to bother this young lady,” responded
Tom, in a low tense voice while his eyes glinted
like steel. “He was annoying you, wasn’t he,
Mary?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he was,” replied Mary excitedly. “And,
oh, Tom, I’m so glad you came! But please,
Tom,” she added more calmly, “don’t make a
scene. Let’s get out of here as soon as possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom relinquished his hold on Hankinshaw’s
collar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re right, Mary,” he agreed. “His case
can wait till another time. But it’s only your
being here that saves him from getting the thrashing
of his life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh!” snorted Hankinshaw, who, while not
quite as tall as Tom, was much bulkier and
heavier. “That’s easy enough to say. Talk is
cheap. What do you suppose I’d be doing while
you were trying to mess me up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing much,” retorted Tom drily. “That
will be enough from you, Hankinshaw. Give me
your parcels, Mary, and I’ll see you home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The nerve of you to lay your hands on me!”
snarled Hankinshaw, who was getting angrier
and angrier. “I’ve a good mind to have you arrested
for assault and battery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Try it,” recommended Tom. “It would be
a good chance to show you up for what you are.
Come along, Mary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gallant knight with his fair lady,” sneered
Hankinshaw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that?” exclaimed Tom, taking a step
toward him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the blaze in the young inventor’s eyes,
Hankinshaw stepped back hastily. As he did so,
his foot struck a box on the floor and he fell
backward and went through the confectioner’s
window. There was a crash of splintering glass,
and the next instant Hankinshaw was on the sidewalk,
surrounded by a litter of glass and a score
or more of candy boxes that had been flung out
with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I do hope he isn’t hurt!” cried Mary, in
a fright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess not,” replied Tom, as they hurried
outside. “You go along, Mary, before a crowd
gathers. I’ll stay behind to help him if necessary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The confectioner had rushed outside with
them, in alarm both for his window and the
man who had gone through it. Mary hastened
on, while Tom and the store owner, a Mr. Wilkins,
helped Hankinshaw to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To their relief, they saw that apart from a few
scratches on one of his hands and the damage to
his dignity, no harm had come to the bulky fellow.
But his eyes were baleful as he glared at
Tom. If hate could have killed, Tom would have
been a dead man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll fix you for this, Swift!” he declared
venomously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You brought it on yourself,” replied Tom.
“I’m glad though that you weren’t seriously injured.
You’d better get back to your hotel before
a crowd gathers. It wouldn’t be pleasant
for you to explain just how you happened to go
through the window. Don’t worry about the
glass, Wilkins,” he continued, turning to the confectioner.
“If he doesn’t pay for it, I will. And
mind, Wilkins, not a word as to the young lady
who was in the store at the time this happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can count on me, Mr. Swift,” replied the
storekeeper, reassured by what Tom had said
about the broken window. “Nobody’ll get anything
out of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was lucky that the accident had occurred at
a time when most of the people of the town were
at supper and the streets were almost deserted.
Some had gathered, however, attracted by the
crash, and more were coming, and to avoid questioning
Tom went off quickly toward his home.
Hankinshaw after a moment of hesitation started
off for his hotel, not caring to have others see
him in his awkward and humiliating position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first thing Tom did on reaching the house
was to take up the telephone and call up Mary.
There was a tremor in her musical voice as she
answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Tom,” she said, “I’m so glad to hear
from you. I’ve been worried to death ever since
I left you. Was the man badly hurt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only a few trifling scratches,” replied Tom.
“The fellow got off better than he deserved.
The last I saw of him he was hot-footing it for
his hotel. What he’d like to do to me is a sin
and a shame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do be careful, Tom,” urged Mary anxiously.
“He had the look in his eyes of a sneak. I’m
afraid that in some underhand way he may do
you an injury. I’ve been worrying, too, for fear
it may affect the business deal you have with him
and his partners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a chance,” laughed Tom. “He couldn’t
back out now without being a loser, and he and
his crowd are too canny for that. Not that I’d
care a bit if he did. I’m half sorry we took the
contract, anyway. If we hadn’t, this Hankinshaw
wouldn’t be hanging around Shopton. But
thank goodness the work is getting pretty well
along now, and in a few weeks the contract will
be completed. Then he’ll be nothing but a bad
dream—perhaps I ought to say a nightmare.
Don’t worry your pretty head any more about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But keep away from him all you can, won’t
you?” pleaded Mary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess he’ll keep away from me,” laughed
Tom. “But I’ll promise you, if that will make
you feel better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom’s prediction proved correct. For several
days Hankinshaw did not appear at all at the
works. And even when he resumed his visits
they were brief and less frequent than usual, and
he avoided meeting Tom as much as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime, the high board fence around
a section of the grounds of the plant had been
completed. Material of various kinds had been
carried in and set up by a group of chosen workmen
under the close supervision of Jackson.
Gradually a structure arose that would have
seemed strange to the eyes of the people of Shopton,
though familiar enough to dwellers in the
oil fields of California, Oklahoma and Texas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom was building an oil derrick and getting
together a full paraphernalia of cables, drills and
other tools necessary in oil-well digging. Everything
was on a miniature scale to save expense,
for the structure was only designed to be temporary
and would be demolished when the need
for it had passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t you going to a good deal of trouble
and expense for this one job?” asked Ned, a
little anxiously. “It won’t take much to eat up
all the profit there is on this contract.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t worry, old boy,” replied Tom. “If
this one contract were the only thing concerned,
this wouldn’t be necessary, for all we have to do
is to follow the specifications of their plan. But
I’m doing this for a different reason. This isn’t
for the benefit of Thompson, Bragden and Hankinshaw,
but for trying out something new for
the Swift Construction Company. Do you get
me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean that you’ve hit on a new invention?”
asked Ned eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something like that,” answered Tom with a
smile. “Not that I’d call it an invention—yet.
I’ve got a whole lot of things to work out in connection
with it. But the idea I’ve struck seems
feasible enough as far as I’ve gone. I’m getting
rid of the technical difficulties one after the other,
and the farther I go, the more convinced I am
that I’m on the right track. But nobody knows
better than you that there’s a long step between
theory and practice. The thing that seems perfect
in the study may prove to be a flivver in the
field. That’s the reason why I’m rigging up this
miniature oil-well outfit. I want to put my idea
to a practical test. Maybe it’ll work. Maybe
it won’t. If it doesn’t, I’ll discard it and hunt
up something better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go to it, Tom, and good luck to you,” cried
Ned enthusiastically. “I’d have bet my life
you’d hit on something new.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold your horses,” cautioned Tom. “The
best laid plans sometimes ‘gang agley.’ I’m a
long way off yet from certainty. But I’m far
enough along to justify this expense to find out
whether I’m right or wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the work went on until the structure was
complete, and any one who entered the gates of
the carefully guarded enclosure would have
rubbed his eyes and wondered how long it was
since Shopton became an oil field.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The most prominent object was the derrick,
or rig, a framework tower wide at the bottom
and tapering off at the top. This was for the
purpose of carrying two pulleys, the crown pulley
in the center and the block through which the
sand line ran. Over the crown pulley ran the
cable by which the drilling tools were suspended
or lowered or raised. At one side of the rig was
the bull wheel, or windlass, upon which the cable
was wound, and at the other was the walking
beam, a heavy timber hung in the center so that
it could undulate up and down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there was a choice collection of drilling
tools, consisting of a bit, an auger-stem, a sinker
bar, a rope socket and jars, all of which were
strung together and suspended from the crown
pulley by the cable. In addition there were the
wrought-iron casings for the lining of the
projected experimental well. Nothing essential
had been overlooked, and before long Tom found
himself in a position to begin the tests on which
he was counting so much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned in the meantime had been having troubles
on the accounting end. At the expiration of the
two weeks when it was stipulated that the second
five thousand dollar payment should be made,
the check was not forthcoming. Ned telegraphed
to Thompson and hunted up Hankinshaw.
Both of them put the blame on Bragden,
who at the time, they stated, was on a short vacation
from which he would return in a few days,
when the matter would be promptly adjusted.
This, however, did not satisfy Ned, who recognized
the familiar tricks of “shoestring” concerns,
and he proceeded at once to “put on the
screws.” But it was only when he threatened
immediate stoppage of work on the contract that
the draft he had sent through was finally honored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told you they were as slippery as eels,” Ned
reminded Tom, as they looked at the cashier’s
check whose delay had been so annoying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and perhaps you wouldn’t have been so
far wrong if you had added that they were as
crooked as corkscrews,” replied Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my premonitions! I’m afraid you’re
right,” exclaimed a voice behind them.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span><h1>CHAPTER IX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE MIDNIGHT PROWLER</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Tom and</span> Ned looked up, a little startled, and
saw their eccentric friend, Mr. Wakefield Damon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my gum shoes!” exclaimed Mr. Damon,
wiping his glasses and settling into the chair that
Tom pulled over for him. “I came in on you
like a thief in the night, and by a coincidence I
hear you talking about thieves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I wouldn’t want to put it as strongly as
that,” said Tom, with a laugh. “But all the
same the actions of that oil crowd don’t seem to
be those of responsible business men. We’ve
been having no end of trouble with them, one
way and another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid perhaps I made a mistake in introducing
them to you,” said Mr. Damon, with a
slightly worried look. “Thompson was the only
one of them I knew, and even with him my acquaintance
was slight. By the way, did you get
that second payment? Ned, here, was telling me
that they seemed to be trying to sidestep it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It came in to-day,” replied Tom. “But we
had a heap of trouble in getting it. Here it is,”
and he handed it over for his friend’s inspection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Damon scrutinized it carefully and heaved
a sigh of relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that puts you on easy street, anyway,”
he said. “They’ll have to come across with the
rest now to save what they’ve already invested.
But I’m afraid somebody else is in for a trimming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean by that?” inquired Tom,
with quickened interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard something when I was on my last
trip to New York that set me thinking,” replied
Mr. Damon. “I dropped into one of the clubs
as the guest of a friend of mine who is a member,
and among the people to whom I was introduced
was a large Texas oil producer. Of
course, that interested me at once, apart from the
fact that he was a most entertaining talker. He
told me a lot about his own experiences there, and
in the course of the conversation got going about
the many “wild-catters” that infest the oil fields.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know the wild-catter is to the legitimate
oil man very much what the bucket-shop keeper
is to the solid Wall Street broker. He hates him
as he does ivy poison. The shady tricks in which
the wild-catter indulges cast a stigma on the
whole oil-producing business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, this man, in giving me some illustrations
of wildcat methods, happened to mention
the name of Thompson. Said he was one of the
most suave and polished individuals that roamed
over the oil fields.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t let on that I knew any one of that
name, but from the description he gave me of
his personal appearance and manners, I feel sure
that it’s this fellow you’re making this material
for. I led him on to tell me what he knew of
him, and if what he said is true, this Thompson
ought to have his picture in the rogues’ gallery.
Not that he ever will probably. He’s too shrewd
for that. Always manages somehow or other to
keep just within the law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Among other things, this new acquaintance
of mine said that he’d heard that Thompson and
his partners were trying to put something over
on an old blind man who owns a likely property
at Goby, I think it was, close to one of the big
gushers that has come in recently. The old man
didn’t want to sell or lease, and the Thompson
crowd were determined to make him. Just how
they were going to bamboozle him or coerce him,
my informant didn’t know, but he had heard
enough before he left to be sure that some shenanigan
was on foot. Said he’d bet a hundred
dollars to a plugged nickel that before many
moons had passed the gang would have the property
and the blind man would find himself
buncoed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So that’s the kind of fellows they are!” exclaimed
Tom hotly. “If I weren’t held by my
contract I wouldn’t do another jot of work for
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, it isn’t a dead certainty that that
Thompson and our Thompson are the same
man,” said Mr. Damon. “It’s a common enough
name, as far as that goes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still, I think they’re identical,” insisted Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At any rate, you’ll be through with the job
soon and then you’ll be rid of them for good and
all. By the way, how’s the work coming
on?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” replied Tom. “Unless something
unforeseen happens we’ll be through on schedule
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that thing on the grounds that looks
like a derrick?” asked Mr. Damon. “It wasn’t
there when I went away. Seems to have gone
up almost over night, like Jonah’s gourd.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s a contrivance that I had built to test
an idea of mine,” answered Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At once Mr. Damon was after the hint like a
terrier after a rat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Invented something new?” he asked eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not quite yet,” replied Tom, with a smile.
“But I’ve hit on an idea that may amount to
something when I’ve worked it out more thoroughly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good for you!” cried Mr. Damon enthusiastically.
“I knew you wouldn’t be at this thing
long before you struck something that would
make anything that had gone before look like
thirty cents. More power to you, my boy.
What does your father think of it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It hits him hard,” replied Tom. “I’ve gone
into the thing pretty thoroughly with him and
I’ve benefited a lot by his suggestions. He thinks
it will mean an immense saving in time, expense
and man power. So far, we haven’t run up
against any obstacle that seems insurmountable.
Still, you never can tell till it actually gets to
working. It may turn out to be a flivver after
all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my modesty!” snorted Mr. Damon unbelievingly.
“Hear Tom Swift talk about flivvering!
That’s one thing he’s never done yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s got to be a first time for everything,”
bantered Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’ll be a long time coming,” retorted Mr.
Damon. “One thing I’m certain of,” he went
on; “and that is you’ll have a mighty fine market
for your invention when you get it perfected.
You’ll have all the big companies bidding
against each other to get hold of it. I tell
you, my boy, there’ll be a fortune in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s hope so,” said Tom. “But the pot of
gold is still at the foot of the rainbow and it
may be a long tramp until I reach it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although Tom expressed himself in this cautious
way, he felt quite certain in his own heart
that he had hit upon a great invention. This
concerned itself with the drill with its sharp cutting
edge, or bit. Up to that time dependence
had been placed upon having a hard tempered
edge that cut into and splintered the rock by its
sharpness, its weight and the distance from which
it fell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was much. But Tom’s theory was that
where there was much there could always be
added more. Suppose a circular motion could
be given to the bit at the moment of contact and
the bit itself so shaped that in addition to the
crushing power given by the weight and fall there
would be a grinding, scooping movement that
would eat into the very heart of the soil or rock,
making each stroke vastly more efficient. If he
could double its effectiveness, he would wipe out
at once half the time required, half the wear and
tear on the machinery, half the man power required,
and vastly reduce the overhead expense.
It would mean an incalculable saving to the oil
industry, and to Tom himself it would mean a
fortune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father agreed with him that he had hit
upon an idea that went to the core of the matter.
Then followed long days and nights of experimenting,
until at last just as the dawn was lighting
up the sky on one memorable morning Tom
leaped from his seat in wild exultation and fairly
shouted:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got it! I’ve got it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the first few minutes of jubilation, he
went over his figures and diagrams again. Yes,
if there was anything in mathematics, he had
proved that the new drill and bit would do what
was expected of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the invention had first to be demonstrated
in actual working, and he pushed forward energetically
the work in his experimental plant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About a week later he was working alone in
the office, when, shortly after midnight, there was
a knock at the door and Koku, whose night it
was for self-imposed duty, entered. His eyes
were rolling in agitation, and he had his fingers
on his lips as though to impose silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, Koku?” asked Tom, somewhat
startled by the air of mystery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“S-sh,” warned Koku. “Man down at fence.
Saw light.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instantly Tom was outside. He looked down
toward the stockade that enclosed the experimental
plant, but could see nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guess you must have been dreaming, Koku,”
he whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Koku. “Light come. Light go.
There is now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom, too, saw a sudden gleam, as suddenly
extinguished, that evidently came from a flashlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, Koku,” he commanded, and moved
down stealthily toward the fence.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span><h1>CHAPTER X<br/> <span class='sub-head'>CAUGHT IN THE ACT</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Despite his</span> great size, Koku was as light on
his feet as a cat, and he made no sound as he
followed in Tom’s footsteps. As silently as
panthers they approached the fence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom had slipped a revolver into his pocket as
he left the office, as a matter of precaution,
though he hardly thought he would have occasion
to use it, and would only do so in the last
extremity. Ordinarily his sinewy arms and
powerful fists were a sufficient reliance. But
there was no telling whether he would have to
face an individual or a gang, and it was well to
be prepared for any emergency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One thing was certain. Whoever was there
had no right to be there and could only have
come for some evil purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had caught one more glance of a flash
of light, but only one. Now everything was in
absolute darkness. There was no moon and the
ordinary blackness of the night was deepened by
heavy clouds that presaged a storm. Tom could
scarcely see his hand before his face, and it was
only by reaching out occasionally and touching
Koku that he knew the latter was close on his
heels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom had a powerful flashlight with him, but
it was unnecessary to use it just then, for he was
so familiar with every foot of the yard that he
could have gone to the fence blindfolded. Besides,
it was essential that the prowler or prowlers
be kept in ignorance that their unlawful visit had
been discovered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon they were near the fence, and Tom
caught one of Koku’s hands and drew him to
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Koku,” he whispered, “I’ll go around
one side of the fence and you go round the other
until we meet. If you come across any one, grab
him and hold him fast. But don’t call out, as
that may warn others who may be with him.
Hold him till I come up to you. No rough stuff.
Don’t hurt him. Just hang on to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Koku nodded and started round one side while
Tom went in the opposite direction. There was
not a sound to break the stillness. If there was
any one about, he was acting with extreme
caution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before long they had together completed the
circuit and met.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you see any one, Koku?” queried Tom,
in a whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” was the reply. “But there is ladder
against fence. Come.” And, turning, the giant,
followed by Tom, went back to where a ladder
was propped against the wall of the enclosure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Tom’s eye ran along its length, a flare of
light stabbed the air but was quickly extinguished.
At first it seemed to him like a faint gleam of
lightning, but there was no thunder, and he realized
that it had probably come from a flashlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Motioning to Koku to remain where he was,
Tom went up the ladder. When he reached the
top, he slowly and cautiously raised his head
above the fence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first he could see nothing except the bulky
derrick, which stood out as a formless blot against
the blackness. But while he listened intently, he
heard the clink of metal as though a hand were
fumbling among tools, and an instant later there
came another flash that revealed the figure of a
man bending down with his back toward him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like a ghost, Tom slipped down the ladder.
Then he laid the ladder flat on the ground, and,
telling Koku to follow, went rapidly around to
the gate of the enclosure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He inserted his key in the lock, opened the
gate slowly so that no grinding of the hinges
should betray his presence, and then like two
shadows the pair moved toward the derrick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the clink of metal guided them, and soon
they were within a few feet of the intruder,
whose form was dimly visible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom drew his flashlight from his pocket and
touched Koku as a signal to be in readiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now!” cried Tom, and flashed his powerful
light full in the face of Hankinshaw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a startled exclamation the latter started
back, while at the same time his hand reached
toward his hip pocket. But in that instant the
giant Koku had leaped upon him and pinioned
his arms behind his back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hankinshaw was a heavily built man and he
struggled violently to free himself. But in
Koku’s hands he was as helpless as an infant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold him, Koku,” commanded Tom, and
went to the derrick. He took a lantern off a
peg, lighted it and returned. He set the lantern
on the ground and pocketed his flashlight. Then
he passed his hands lightly over Hankinshaw’s
clothes and drew from the latter’s pocket a revolver,
fully loaded. He broke the stock, took
out the cartridges and threw the now useless
weapon on the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During this process, Hankinshaw fumed and
frothed and burst out in imprecations, to all of
which Tom paid not the slightest attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now put him down on the ground, Koku,”
directed Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The giant obeyed, and Hankinshaw found himself
sitting on the ground with startling suddenness.
He started to get up, but Koku’s hands
on his shoulders put him back with a force that
jarred him and made his teeth chatter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better stay put,” warned Tom. “That man
of mine doesn’t know how strong he really is,
and if he grabs you again you’re apt to get hurt.
It will be healthier for you to stay right where
you are until I tell you to get up. Get me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hankinshaw evidently did “get” him, and sat
still, his face black with rage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is an infernal outrage,” he shouted.
“I’ll get even with you, and don’t you forget it.
What do you mean by assaulting me in this way,
you and your man? I’ll——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A long string of threats and expletives followed.
Tom let him rave, looking steadily at
him the while until beneath the blistering contempt
in his eyes Hankinshaw faltered, sputtered
and tapered off into a confused and incoherent
snarl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you through now?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not through with you, by a long shot,”
snarled Hankinshaw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whether you are or not, you’re going to listen
to me now,” said Tom. “Unless,” he added, as
though by an afterthought, “you’d rather have
the police and the district attorney do the talking?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the word “police” Hankinshaw’s face
blanched and his bluster dropped away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because, you know,” went on Tom, “this is
a police matter. I find you in the dead of night
on my property after scaling a locked enclosure,
handling my implements, and for all I know getting
ready to carry them away. It’s as though I
woke up in my room at night and found a burglar
rifling my bureau drawers. The fact that he
didn’t have time to get anything before I nabbed
him wouldn’t prevent his being tried and convicted
for burglary. I imagine that if I chose
to hand you over they’d put you where the dogs
couldn’t bite you for a while.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hankinshaw moistened his parched lips with
his tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no use talking that way,” he said, and
there was unmistakable fear in his voice. “Why
should I want to take anything away? And how
could I if I did want to? They’re too heavy to
handle. Do you think I’d walk off with your
derrick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop your stalling, Hankinshaw, and tell me
the truth—that is, if you can,” commanded Tom
sharply. “What were you doing in this enclosure
at this time of night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why—why, I was restless and—and couldn’t
sleep,” stammered Hankinshaw. “So I dressed
and went out——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a nice little moonlight stroll, I suppose,”
interrupted Tom sarcastically, looking up at the
lowering sky.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span><h1>CHAPTER XI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A RASCAL FOILED</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>I went</span> out,” continued Hankinshaw, affecting
not to notice the unbelief in Tom’s voice,
“for a walk——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Taking your revolver along,” suggested Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a habit I got down in Texas. One
never knows down in the oil fields when it is
going to come in handy. As I was saying, I
went out for a walk and found myself coming
in this direction. I happened to catch sight of
the derrick——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did you see it from?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From the road, of course,” answered Hankinshaw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You caught sight of the derrick from the
road three hundred feet away on a night when
you couldn’t see anything ten feet ahead of you?”
exclaimed Tom. “But go ahead. You interest
me strangely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t mean exactly that I saw it,” said
Hankinshaw, in confusion. “But I’d seen it in
the daytime, and being so near it I suppose the
thought of it came into my mind. Just from
curiosity, I thought I’d come over and see what
it was like. I didn’t think any one would mind.
Didn’t know there was anything especially secret
about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t suspect that even when you found the
gate was locked, eh?” queried Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” affirmed Hankinshaw brazenly. “I was
turning away when I stumbled against a ladder
that some workman had left in the grass. That
put it into my mind that I could get a squint at
the derrick after all, and on the impulse of the
moment I put it up and climbed over the fence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How lucky it was that you just happened to
have a flashlight along,” said Tom. “I suppose
carrying flashlights is another habit you got down
in Texas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” returned Hankinshaw. “You have to
travel around a good deal at night there, and you
never know when you may need one. But now
I’ve told you the whole story. I suppose I was
trespassing, and I’m sorry now I did it, seeing
the way you look at it. But you’re just making
a mountain out of a molehill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I imagine a burglar might say the same
thing,” replied Tom, and his tone was so like
steel that Hankinshaw visibly winced. “Now
listen to me, Hankinshaw. I don’t believe a
word of what you’ve been saying. It’s a falsehood
from beginning to end. You deliberately
committed a crime to-night, and you know as
well as I do what chance you’d have if you told
a fairy tale like this to a judge or jury. All I’d
have to do would be to telephone to police headquarters
and you’d be under lock and key in a
hurry. But I’m not going to do that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An expression of immense relief came into the
rascal’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s not out of any consideration for you,”
Tom assured him. “It’s partly because I don’t
want any scandal that would worry my father;
in his present feeble state of health. Then, too,
I’m too busy just now to take the time to prosecute
you and send you where you belong. But
don’t think for a moment that this ridiculous
story of yours has imposed on me. You came
to this plant to-night with one of two purposes
in view.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hankinshaw started to protest, but Tom cut
him short.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t add any more lies to those you’ve already
told,” he said. “You may have had revenge
in mind for what happened the other night
down in the town. You may have thought that
you’d be able to cripple the machinery here and
put me to a lot of expense and trouble. That’s
one possibility, and knowing you as I do I
wouldn’t put it past you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the other hand, you may have had it in
mind to steal some invention I might be trying
out here. You know that invention is my line,
and you may have thought that I had discovered
some improvement or new device to be used in
oil digging that you could get hold of and turn
to your profit. That would explain why you
were so carefully handling and examining the
tools here when we came upon you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of these two things, perhaps both, was
in your mind to-night when you stole in here like
a thief. I don’t know which and I don’t care.
But just let me tell you one thing, Hankinshaw.
If I ever catch you hanging around this place
again either by day or night, may heaven have
mercy on you, for I won’t. There’ll be a guard
here after this during every one of the twenty-four
hours. He’ll be armed, and he’ll have his
orders what to do to any vermin that may be
trying to worm its way into this enclosure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, that’ll be about all. Stand up and get
out of here and get out quick. Koku, you go
down with him till he reaches the road. Don’t
hurt him, but keep close behind him. Now, Hankinshaw,
pick up that revolver of yours and go.
And don’t forget a single word of what I’ve said
to you, for I mean every syllable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The baffled miscreant got up, muttering things
that he was careful to say under his breath.
Koku, menacing as fate, stood hovering over
him. The giant had not understood much of
what had been said, but he knew that this man
was his master’s enemy and nothing would have
given him greater pleasure than to wring the
rascal’s neck. Hankinshaw was fully conscious
of this, and he sullenly pocketed the now useless
revolver and moved toward the gate, with Koku
stalking close behind him. As he passed Tom, he
favored him with a glance that was malignity itself.
Then he passed out into the darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Him bad man—so bad man,” grunted the
giant, as he came back to Tom’s side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon you are right, Koku,” answered the
young inventor. “But we caught him red-handed,
didn’t we?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Him like snake in the grass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So he is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Him do harm to Massa Tom. Must watch
out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you think he is a bad egg, do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Him worse than many bad eggs!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, maybe, Koku. We’ll see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom extinguished the lantern, hung it in its
place, locked the gate carefully and returned to
the office. It was now long past midnight, but
he was too wrought up to have any desire to
sleep. He sat with his elbows on the desk and
his head in his hands, immersed in thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What had been Hankinshaw’s real motive?
On reflection, Tom dismissed the idea that he
had intended to cripple the machinery. Much
more probable it seemed to him that the fellow
had heard in some way that he was busy on some
new invention, that the machinery had been
rigged up for the purpose of testing it, and that
he might make a fortune if he could steal the
idea and have it patented before Tom himself
should have time to do it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But how could he have heard of it? Tom had
been extremely careful to keep the matter in the
circle of a few trusted friends. His father, Ned,
Jackson and Mr. Damon were the only ones that
knew of it. The first three would have been as
silent as the grave concerning it. As for Mr.
Damon, although he was impulsive and talkative,
he was a keen business man and knew too well
the importance of secrecy in a matter of this kind
to speak of it to anybody, much less to a fellow
like Hankinshaw, whom he disliked and distrusted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was but one conclusion. Hankinshaw
had acted on a probability. He could not have
been hanging around Shopton so long without
having heard of the marvelous inventive genius
of Tom, and he had jumped to the conclusion
that this would have been turned in the direction
of oil-well machinery while he was working to
fulfill his contract. He had acted on the guess,
and it was by the merest chance that he had been
thwarted. If Koku had not happened to see that
flash of light! Good old Koku!</p>

<p class='pindent'>One thing was certain. Hankinshaw, already
an enemy, was now a deadly one. He would
never forget or forgive the humiliation he had
suffered that night. Tom must be on his guard.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span><h1>CHAPTER XII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE NEW DRILL</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Tom did</span> not mention the matter of Hankinshaw’s
behavior to his father the next day, because
he did not want to worry him. He had
also put Koku under a strict injunction not to
speak of the events of the night. But to Ned,
when he turned up at the office, he narrated the
whole affair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The latter was boiling over with indignation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a pity that you didn’t give him all that
was coming to him,” he declared. “There isn’t
a doubt but what you could have sent him to
prison. Still, I suppose you were right in not
giving the matter publicity. I tell you, Tom,
we’re dealing with a shady crowd, and I wish
we’d never taken the contract.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I,” agreed Tom. “And I’ll be heartily
glad when the whole matter’s off our hands. Of
course, this special thing was probably done by
Hankinshaw without the knowledge of the
others. He was playing a lone hand, and if he’d
got hold of the invention he’d have got all the
profit from it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe,” assented Ned. “But Thompson and
Bragden, although more polished, are probably
just as crooked at heart. It’s my opinion the
whole gang are tarred with the same brush. All
I want now is to see the last of them. When
we’ve once delivered the last shipment and have
got our money for it, I’ll feel like celebrating.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we’ll only have to be patient for about
two weeks more,” Tom consoled him. “Jackson
agreed with me yesterday that it will take only
that time to finish up the contract. By the way,
how about that third check for five thousand?
It’s due now, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was due three days ago,” answered Ned.
“Late, as usual. I’ve had to draw on them.
Like pulling teeth to get anything out of them.
We have to do our work twice over—once in
actually doing it and the second time in getting
our money for it. But we’ve got them on the
hip now. They’ve paid so much that it will be
more profitable for them now to pay the rest than
to cheat us out of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s some silver lining to the cloud, anyway,”
observed Tom more cheerfully. “If it
hadn’t been for this contract I wouldn’t have
been thinking about oil and wouldn’t have perfected
this new idea of mine. We’ll forget all
about this bother when the money comes rolling
in from the patent rights. That is, if it does,”
he added, with a return to his habitual caution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No modifications, you old gloom hound,”
laughed Ned. “You gave yourself away that
time. Own up, old boy, you know that you’ve
got a good thing. Come now, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom grinned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the level, Ned, I feel pretty sure of it,”
he confessed. “Of course, ‘there’s many a slip
between the cup and the lip,’ and I may be letting
myself in for a disappointment. The next
few days will tell. By day after to-morrow I’ll
be all ready to put the new drill to a practical
test. It won’t take long to know whether it’s
going to work or not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next two days were busy ones for Tom.
He was, too, at high nervous tension, wondering
whether his idea would “go over big” or fail.
He had checked and re-checked on his figures,
and could find no flaw in them. And figures did
not lie. Still——</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw nothing of Hankinshaw. Either the
man had left town temporarily or he was keeping
carefully under cover. Tom did not care
which, as long as the rascal kept out of his way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last the momentous morning came when
Tom was to try out his new drill. A few trusted
workmen had been chosen to work the machinery.
That was all they were concerned with, and
they would be in no position to gauge the meaning
of whatever results would be obtained.
Jackson was there to help, and Ned and his father
were also on hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The miniature well was started, and for a time
nothing was heard but the creaking of the derrick
and the chugging of the drill as it worked its way
through the soil. Tom, of course, knew the ordinary
rate of progress made in well digging with
the usual type of drill. But by how much would
he be able to beat it? Or would he beat it at
all?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The morning passed with interest at fever
heat. It seemed to Tom that he was making
rapid progress. But the results of any one hour
would not give him a sufficient basis to generalize
from. Special circumstances might make the results
small or great. The work would have to
be spread over several hours before he could
reach an average from which he could draw safe
and sound conclusions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At noon the men stopped for lunch, but Tom
was too much excited to eat. He spent that time
in studying the character of the soil through
which the drill had been biting its way and the
depth that it had reached.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The results astounded him. He thought he
must have made a mistake in his calculations and
went over them again. But no. The figures
were correct. Was he dreaming?</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father, who had been looking over his
shoulder, was equally startled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Tom!” he exclaimed, “do you realize
what that means? That’s three times as much
as you could have got with the ordinary drill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” said Tom, in a voice that he tried
to keep calm. “I thought I must have miscalculated.
Do you see any error in the figures?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None at all,” was the answer. “They’re perfectly
correct. But it seems almost beyond
belief.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Tom, “one swallow doesn’t make
a summer, and one test doesn’t prove that others
will be just like it. Perhaps the soil was lighter
and easier to penetrate than it really seems. The
real test will come when we strike rock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They struck rock that afternoon, and the way
the drill ground and scrunched its way through
it was music to Tom’s ears. It ate its way with
surprising rapidity, which was the more remarkable
because the specimens brought up showed
it to be of a remarkably hard quality. Here
again the same comparative gain was made over
the ordinary rate of rock penetration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still Tom refused to be rushed off his feet,
and the work went on for two days more, days
of steadily decreasing doubt, days of steadily increasing
jubilation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the end of the third day, Tom knew that
beyond the peradventure of a doubt he had
“struck it.” He would have been delighted if
his new drill had proved to be able to do half as
much again as the one commonly in use. He
would have been astounded had it proved to be
able to do twice as much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the result had far outrun his wildest expectations.
The principle that he had embodied
in his new drill had <span class='it'>trebled</span> its effectiveness. He
had hit on something that was destined to revolutionize
the oil industry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more that inventive brain of Tom Swift’s
would startle the world!</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A NIGHT OF TRIUMPH</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>All his</span> close friends were with Tom in the
office on the memorable night when his hopes became
certainty. His father, Ned and Mr. Damon
had hung breathlessly on his final calculations,
and when he at last looked up with the triumphant
smile that could mean only one thing, they
were almost as jubilant as he and overwhelmed
him with congratulations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my oil stocks!” cried Mr. Damon, slapping
him on the shoulder. “Tom, my boy, you’re
a wonder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got all other inventors tied to the mast
and screeching for help,” affirmed Ned, as he
wrung his friend’s hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew you would do it,” said his father
quietly, as he wiped his glasses. And to Tom
this calm, affectionate assurance was the sweetest
praise of all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sure that the patent has been attended
to all right?” asked Mr. Damon anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can bet,” answered Tom. “We had a
wire from Reid and Crawford, our Washington
lawyers, to-day, and they tell us that everything
is O. K. It doesn’t infringe on any previous
patent, and the idea of the drill is entirely new.
The lawyers themselves think it’s great.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The next thing, I suppose,” went on Mr.
Damon, “will be to get in touch with some of
the big companies, tell them what your drill can
do, give them a demonstration and then lean back
and let them bid against each other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“N-no,” replied Tom thoughtfully, “I don’t
think that will be the next thing. I’m not quite
ready for that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole company looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just what do you mean by that?” asked Ned,
in a puzzled way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why,” said Tom, “I’ve been thinking that I
might go down to the oil fields and take a whirl
myself at oil-well digging. What’s the matter,”
he added with a grin, “with becoming a magnate
on my own account?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a chorus of exclamations. None
had had the slightest intimation that Tom had
been thinking of anything of the kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s put that idea into your head?” asked
his father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been reading and thinking so much about
oil lately that it’s sort of got a grip on me,” replied
Tom. “I’m eager to see the thing at first
hand. Then, too, I want to put the drill to work
on a real honest-to-goodness well. I’ll be much
better qualified after that to talk business to any
one who may want to buy the invention. Then,
too, I may find that we can make more money by
keeping the invention for ourselves than we can
by selling it to somebody. Of course, it’s only
an idea as yet, and I haven’t thought it through.
My present impression, however, is that I’ll go
down there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When do you think of going?” asked Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just as soon as we get this oil-well machinery
contract off our hands,” was the answer.
“Say, about a month from now. How would
you like to go with me, Ned?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like it above all things,” answered Ned.
“I guess we could get things in shape so that the
business would go on all right for the few weeks
we’d be gone. And your father would be here
to supervise things generally.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my railroad ticket! I’ll go along too,”
exclaimed their eccentric friend. “I always like
to keep an eye on what Tom is doing. I’ve had
a hankering, too, for a long time to see what an
oil field is like. Count me in on this. That is,
of course, if you want me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You bet we want you,” said Tom cordially.
“It wouldn’t seem natural if you weren’t somewhere
within hail. My airplane will easily carry
the three of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my life insurance! No, no,” cried Mr.
Damon. “You young fellows can go that way,
but I’m a little too much under the weather just
now for that. The railroad will be plenty good
enough for me this time. But I’ll make the trip
so that I’ll get there about the same time you do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Mr. Damon, are you really going to
give up sky flying?” questioned Tom, in surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only this time, Tom. Bless my wings! I
can’t be with you always. Besides, I’ve got to
stop off at Washington and maybe one or two
other cities on business. But, as I said before,
I’ll fix it so I’ll get down there about the same
time you do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was some further discussion of the matter,
and when they separated, the trip had been
practically decided upon, only the exact date remaining
to be fixed later on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next night Tom ran up to make a call on
Mary. He had been so engrossed of late with
his invention that he had been able to see her but
seldom, although there had not been a day when
they had not talked together over the telephone.
But feeling toward each other as Tom and Mary
did, the telephone, they found, was a very inadequate
substitute for a face-to-face talk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Mary, Tom had confided the fact that he
was working on a new invention, but he had not
laid much stress upon it, as he did not want to
raise her expectations so high that she would
feel keenly disappointed if it should amount to
nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, however, he had succeeded and was in
high feather. He pictured to himself the delight
on her face when he should tell her of the new
invention and what he hoped from it. Her praise
would be his greatest reward. His happiness in
success would be doubled by her sharing in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stopped on his way to buy some candy;
and flowers, and, thus furnished, hurried along
to Mary’s house and rang the bell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instead of a happy face it was a frightened
one that Tom saw when Mary opened the door.
But it lighted with infinite relief when she saw
who it was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Tom, I’m so glad, so glad that you’ve
come!” she exclaimed. “I never needed you so
much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter?” asked Tom, in quick
alarm. “Any one sick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Mary. “It’s that horrid man—that
Hankinshaw. He forced himself into the
house on the pretext that he wanted to talk business
with father. He’s been drinking. He——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Tom had already dropped his packages.
Be went into the living room with a rush. Mrs.
Nestor, pale-faced and agitated, was standing in
a corner wringing her hands. Mr. Nestor, still
far from robust after his recent illness, was expostulating
with Hankinshaw and trying to push
him outside of the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom took it all in with a glance. The next
instant he had grabbed Hankinshaw by the collar
and whirled him around.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>KICKED FOR A GOAL</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>A look</span> of fear came into the red mottled face
of Hankinshaw when he saw who had hold of
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leggo o’ me,” he said, in a thick voice.
“Whazzer matter with you, anyhow? Regular
Buttinski!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without saying a word, Tom, with one push
of his sinewy arm, shoved the fellow out of the
room. Without relinquishing his grasp on his
collar he forced him through the hall. Mary
shrank aside as she watched them coming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold the door open, Mary, please,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did so and the two antagonists passed out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now close it again, please,” called Tom, who
did not want her to see what was going to happen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The instant the door clicked Tom released his
hold on Hankinshaw’s collar, measured the distance
and gave him a tremendous kick that sent
him forward as though he had been struck by a
catapult. The man tried to keep his balance, but
was unable to do so and went down to the sidewalk
on his hands and knees. He scrambled
snarling to his feet, to find himself facing Tom,
whose face was blazing with wrath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now take yourself off, you loafer,” commanded
Tom. “That kick was only a sample
of what I’ll do to you if you don’t. Get along
now, or I’ll muss you up so that your best friends
won’t know you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was such deadly determination in the
youth’s voice and the force of that kick had been
so mighty that Hankinshaw, who had clenched
his fists, thought better of it and, contenting himself
with a string of coarse expressions, slouched
on along the street. Tom watched him until he
had disappeared and then returned to the door,
which opened at his approach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you didn’t get into a fight, Tom,”
Mary said anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom’s eyes twinkled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing like that,” he laughed. “Do I look
it? Is my hair mussed? No, I simply had a
little football practice. Hankinshaw was the
football. I kicked him for a goal. I guess you
won’t see any more of him. He’s due to get
out of this town anyway in a few days more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary sighed happily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re our good angel, Tom,” she said.
“You saved my father’s life once, and you always
turn up when I need you most. I don’t
know what we’d do without you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t have to do without me,” replied
Tom. “In fact, you couldn’t lose me if you
tried,” and he grinned broadly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary’s parents thanked Tom heartily for his
opportune appearance and the way he had rid
them of their obnoxious visitor, and then, because
they were wise parents, they slipped away
on different pretexts and left the young people
to themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom’s new invention and his projected trip to
Texas were eagerly discussed by the pair. As
regards the first, Mary was enthusiastic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s simply wonderful,” she said, after Tom
had detailed to her as far as he could the plan of
his drill, what it had already done and what he
expected it to do. “I don’t see where on earth
you get all those ideas of yours from. Think of
all the men who have been studying along those
lines for years without hitting on the thing that
you’ve developed in a few weeks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, some one has to think of it first,” replied
Tom. “Then, too, remember that I had the
benefit of what others have already done. It’s
like a band of pioneers going through a forest
and taking turns cutting down the trees to make
a trail. Some one of them gets the axe that cuts
down the last tree. But he wouldn’t be there
to cut it down if he hadn’t walked up to it along
the paths that the other fellows have made first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just your modest way of putting it,”
said Mary. “In this case the last tree was the
toughest, and you cut it down in half the time
any one else would. So there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to have you on the jury if I were
being tried for my life,” laughed Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But concerning the trip to Texas, Mary was
not by any means so enthusiastic. In fact, her
pretty lips had a decided pout.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s an awfully long way off,” she said, “and
when you get down there with your old oil well
you’ll forget all about poor little me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t worry, Mary,” he answered. “I’ll
write every day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next few days flew by as though on wings,
for every waking hour was crowded. There
were many details to be attended to in connection
with the approaching trip. Tom had decided
to take along with him the flying boat that
he had used in his trip to Iceland. It was a
bigger one than he ordinarily would have needed,
but he wanted to carry along a good deal of material
in addition to that which he would send
by rail, so that he would lose no time in getting
to work on the oil well he proposed to dig. The
plane needed a good deal of overhauling to get
it into perfect condition, and Tom often found
himself wishing that he had a dozen hands instead
of only two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned, too, had troubles to adjust and was kept
as busy, to use his expression, as a “one-armed
paperhanger with the hives.” The contract with
the Hankinshaw crowd had been completed and
the material was ready for shipment. But the
final check in payment was slow in coming.
When at last it did come, Ned advised that they
should not at once ship the machinery. He telegraphed
the bank and found that there was not
sufficient money on hand to meet the check when
presented. The idea of the sharpers had been,
of course, that in the ordinary course the check
would not be presented for several days at the
California bank. Then, if refused, several days
more would elapse before the protested check
would get back to Shopton. By that time they
figured that the material would be far on its way
to Texas and the Swift Construction Company
could whistle for its money.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But anybody that gets the best of Ned Newton
in financial matters will have to get up pretty
early in the morning, and the Hankinshaw crowd
did not get up early enough,” laughed Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned’s precautionary telegram thwarted the
scheme, and the foiled conspirators, after lame
explanations, were forced to pay in actual cash—no
check this time—for the final payment. Then
the stop order was lifted and the material was
put on board the train for its long journey to the
oil fields.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that’s that,” remarked Ned, with a sigh
of relief after the last detail had been attended
to. “Thank goodness, that’s off our hands.
The Swift Construction Company never had so
much bother with a contract in its life. When
those fellows want some more machinery, I’d
say, let them apply to some one else. We’re fed
up with them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right you are,” agreed Tom. “Just what
part of Texas did you ship it to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Copperhead,” answered Ned. “That’s right
in the heart of a newly developed oil region.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Copperhead,” repeated Tom. “Sounds like a
snake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’ll be some snakes there when the Hankinshaw
crowd get on the job,” affirmed Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think we’ll make that our destination,” said
Tom thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” asked Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Tom, “we’ve got to pick out some
place to begin, and that’s probably as good as
any other. Then, too, I have some curiosity to
see what Hankinshaw and his brother snakes are
doing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whom they’re doing, you mean,” suggested
Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose that would be more correct,” said
Tom with a smile. “What I’m thinking of especially
is that old blind man that Mr. Damon told
us about. You remember, don’t you, that he
said that the Hankinshaw crowd were out to
swindle him out of his property? Perhaps we
can put a spoke in their wheel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned groaned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great Scott, Tom!” he exclaimed. “Can’t
you stick to business and stop looking for
trouble?”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span><h1>CHAPTER XV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>OFF FOR THE OIL FIELDS</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Tom grinned</span> at the earnestness in Ned’s tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be worried, old boy,” he said. “We’ll
give all the attention to business that it needs.
But if on the side we can at the same time help
an old fellow along, why shouldn’t we? But
that’s a matter that we can settle when we come
to it. All we have to do now is to get ready for
the trip.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before he left for Texas, Tom went up again
to the hospital to get news of the young aviator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he’s getting along,” replied Dr. Sherwood
to Tom’s question. “That is, physically.
His leg has mended, though he still has to use
a cane. But his head isn’t clear yet. He can’t
talk intelligently. As a matter of fact, perhaps
he never will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t mean that he may be insane for
the rest of his life!” exclaimed Tom, genuinely
shocked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s among the possibilities,” affirmed the
doctor. “Though considering his youth and vitality—he’s
a strong young fellow—the chances
are that he’ll recover. Still, no one can tell.
You can go out and take a look at him yourself
if you like. He’s sunning himself on a bench in
the garden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom went out and seated himself on the bench
beside the invalid. He had a good look at him
for the first time under anything like normal
conditions. The young aviator had evidently
been sinewy and stalwart when in health, judging
from his frame, though now thin from his
long illness. His face must have been a pleasant
one, though marred now by the vacant look
in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom tried to get in conversation with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are you, Hillobie?” he asked, using the
name at a venture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy looked at him without any sign of
interest and made no reply. Tom tried again
several times but fruitlessly, and at last had to
give it up. He left the hospital in a depressed
mood, wondering if, after all, he had done the
young man a real service in saving his life. Of
what use was life without reason?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Swift Construction Company hurried
things along, and in about a week Tom was ready
for the start. The young inventor had decided
to take Koku with him, as his great strength and
loyal devotion might prove invaluable. The
giant was in great glee and grinned from ear to
ear when apprised of Tom’s decision, but Rad
was thoroughly disgusted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To hev dat big chunk o’ beef clutterin’ up
the plane!” he snorted. “Doan know whut you
must be t’inkin’ uv, Marse Tom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But don’t you see, Rad,” said Tom soothingly,
trying to keep a serious face, “that I wouldn’t
dare go off and leave this place alone without you
to take care of things? How could I have an easy
minute unless I could keep saying to myself:
‘Everything’s all right at home. Rad’s on the
job?’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old negro bridled up proudly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guess yo’s right, Marse Tom,” he chuckled,
all his resentment vanishing. “Didn’t see it dat
way befo’. Takes brains to run dis yere house.
An’ when it cums to brains, dat big grampus
Koku ain’t dere. Nussah, he jes’ ain’t dere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So peace was reëstablished between Tom’s
faithful retainers, each of whom thought the
other had special reason to envy him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last all was ready. Tom had had a long
and tender interview with Mary, the final directions
had been given for the running of the works
during the absence of Tom and Ned, and one
bright morning, with many of Tom’s friends and
all the workmen assembled to bid the voyagers
Godspeed, the <span class='it'>Winged Arrow</span> rose like a huge
bird from the grounds of the plant, soared high
in air to the altitude of two thousand feet, and
turned her nose toward the oil fields of Texas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom had figured that, barring accidents and
with ordinary good luck, he would be able to
reach his destination on the following day. This
was asking a good deal of the <span class='it'>Winged Arrow</span>, but
the result justified Tom’s confidence. The engines
ran like a dream, the weather was superb,
neither fog nor storm intervened, and on the
afternoon of the following day those in the airship
sighted the town of which they were in
search.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It lay beneath them sprawling in the heat of
the Texas sun, one of the hastily built pioneer
towns that spring up like magic in the wake of
an oil strike. It was a mere collection of wooden
shacks that looked as though little more than a
breath would be required to blow them down.
But they sufficed for the immediate needs of the
hardy adventurers who were seeking a quick road
to fortune. Many had found it, many more
hoped to find it. The man “stony broke” in the
morning might be a millionaire before night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom circled about, looking for a likely landing
place. This was not a matter of much difficulty,
for there was a host of open spaces on the outskirts
of the town. He soon found one suited
to his purpose, and the <span class='it'>Winged Arrow</span> came
down as softly as a swan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scarcely had she stopped before the passengers
were out on the ground, stretching their cramped
legs on Texas soil. It was a delightful change
after their long confinement in the plane. The
warmth, too, was congenial, contrasting as it did
so strongly with the chill of the upper air. They
were in high spirits over the successful termination
of the flight. Tom and Ned laughed aloud,
and Koku was one broad grin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So far, so good,” remarked Tom, patting the
<span class='it'>Winged Arrow</span> proudly. “You certainly are the
goods, old girl. Now for the town and a hot
meal. You’ll have to stay here and mind the
plane, Koku, but we’ll see that you get yours
later.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few minutes they were in the town. It
was their first experience in such surroundings,
and they looked about them curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no pretence at order or regularity
in the shacks that served as dwellings and business
houses. It seemed as though they had been
built wherever the traveler had dropped his pack.
There was one main street, a long, straggling,
crooked thoroughfare, from which a number of
smaller streets branched off here and there at irregular
intervals. The houses were of the rudest
description. Two or three men and one day
would have sufficed to build most of them.
Many of them were of the one-story type with
one or two rooms and earth floors. Others, more
pretentious, had two stories, the lower part occupied
for business purposes and the upper floor
as a residence. Let the mere tail-end of a Texas
norther come along and they would all have been
leveled to the ground like a pack of cards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Most of the “business” houses were saloons
and dance halls. The prohibition law was largely
a dead letter as far as Copperhead was concerned.
From almost every door the young men passed
came the rattle of dice and the clink of bottle
against glass, the wheeze of an old accordion or
raucous jazz music from a phonograph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through the main street passed an almost endless
column of wide-wheeled trucks with tugging
horses straining in the harness, the trucks themselves
loaded with iron casings, and, some of
them, with red flags at the back, carrying enough
nitro-glycerine to blow the town sky-high in the
event of a collision. Weaving in and out of
these were dusty automobiles, mule carts driven
by negroes, “buggies,” every kind of conveyance,
some of them looking as though they dated back
to Revolutionary times. Other vehicles were
parked in rows about saloons, on the front
porches of which loungers sat in tipped-back
chairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And derricks! There were derricks everywhere,
some of them in the town itself, in back
yards where the precious fluid had been discovered.
Some of the buildings were plastered with
oil that had spattered against them in a black
flood when a strike had been made. And all
about the town for as far as the eye could reach
rose a multitude of derricks in a perfect forest,
towering, some of them, to the height of eighty
or a hundred feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through the roughly dressed multitudes that
thronged the principal street, Tom and Ned
threaded their way. Airplanes had become common
in that locality, and no one paid any especial
attention to the aviator suits in which the
youths were clad. There was little choice as to
restaurants. None of them was good, and it
was only a question of which was the least bad.
Even this could not be determined at a glance,
and the lads finally entered one that seemed to
be at least no worse than the others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor was there much choice as to food. The
rough-looking waiter in a dirty apron told them
they could have corned beef and cabbage or ham
and eggs. They ordered the latter, which soon
made their appearance, accompanied by cups of
weak, muddy coffee. Then, while they ate, they
looked curiously about them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The restaurant, like all others in the town, was
only an adjunct to a saloon, and the sale of drinks
was much more profitable than that of food.
Before the bar a long line of the thirsty stood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly Ned nudged Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look who’s here,” he whispered.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span><h1>CHAPTER XVI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>ON THE TRAIL OF FORTUNE</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Tom looked</span> in the direction indicated, and
among the men standing at the bar saw Hankinshaw.
The mottled face was even redder than
usual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t seem to avoid that fellow,” remarked
Tom disgustedly. “He’s a regular jinx.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Either Hankinshaw had not seen them or he
had not recognized them in their aviators’ suits,
for he paid no attention to them. He took one
drink more and then lurched unsteadily out of
the place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom and Ned finished their meal and went to
the shack that served as post-office and telegraph
station. Tom sent off messages to his father
and Mary, announcing their safe arrival, and
then made some inquiries of the telegraph operator,
a bright young college boy who was
“fingering the key” to earn some extra money
during his vacation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is the town of Goby near here?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No town of that name in this section,” was
the answer. “But there’s a Goby farm owned
by a man of that name about four miles from
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess that’s the place I have in mind,” said
Tom, “though from what a friend of mine told
me I thought it was the name of a town. Is the
owner of it a blind man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” was the answer. “A nice old fellow
he is, too, and he has a daughter that’s a perfect
peach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me about him, will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understand that he’s a Northerner who
came down to this part of the country to regain
his health. Since he came here he’s gone blind.
I imagine he’s had rather hard sledding to get
along on his half section of land. That is, before
the oil craze began. As far as I can learn,
his property is right in the midst of the oil region,
and he’ll probably be able to sell it at a
good price. That is, if he doesn’t get cheated out
of it. Some of these oil prospectors are a pretty
slick lot. They’d steal the penny off a dead
man’s eyes, and they’d rob a blind man as quickly
as they’d take a drink.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose so,” remarked Tom. “You say
that this farm is about four miles from here.
Could you give us more exact directions?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The obliging operator could and did, and Tom
and Ned hurried back to their plane, taking with
them two quarts of coffee and a double portion
of ham and eggs and rolls that they had had put
up for the faithful Koku.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the giant feasted, Tom took his bearings,
and as soon as Koku had finished they
climbed into the <span class='it'>Winged Arrow</span> and turned it in
the direction of the Goby farm. To make a mile
a minute was nothing to the powerful plane, and
in less than five minutes it was hovering over a
homestead which answered to the description
that the operator had given. It was in slightly
rolling country with several hills in the vicinity,
differing from the unrelieved flat plain on which
Copperhead stood. It was a pleasant place and
seemed like an oasis amid the throng of derricks
that reared themselves on every side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The house itself was a substantial two-story
structure with a sloping roof. There were white
curtains at the windows and a perfect riot of
flowers at the front and around two sides of
the building. The whiteness and the daintiness
of the curtains seemed to show the presence of
a feminine hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom made a landing about three hundred feet
from the house. A movement among the curtains
showed that the roar of the engine had
attracted attention from at least one of the inmates.
Leaving Koku with the plane, Tom and
Ned made their way to the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom knocked and the door was promptly
opened by one of the most charming girls imaginable.
She was slightly above medium height,
had a perfect figure, beautifully formed features,
and wavy chestnut hair and limpid brown eyes.
It was evident that the enthusiastic young telegraph
operator had not erred when he had described
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Tom, with his mind and heart full of Mary,
she was simply a very pretty girl. To Ned, she
seemed a heavenly vision, the sweetest thing he
had ever seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does Mr. Goby live here?” asked Tom, removing
his cap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” was the reply, in a soft, musical voice
that completed Ned’s undoing. “I am his daughter.
Won’t you walk in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My name is Swift,” said Tom, as they accepted
her invitation, “and this is my friend,
Mr. Newton. We came to see your father on a
little business matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you will sit down,” she said, as she ushered
them into the living room and indicated
chairs, “I will call him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She vanished, followed by Ned’s eyes. Tom,
looking at his friend, saw him staring at the door
through which she had disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hard hit, old boy?” he bantered. “Come
out of your trance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned glared at him, but before he could frame
a suitable retort the young girl came back, accompanied
by a man whom she introduced as her
father. Then she excused herself, flushing a
trifle as she caught the all too evident admiration
in Ned’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Goby was a medium-built man somewhat
over fifty, with a kindly and intelligent face.
He wore a pair of colored spectacles, evidently
to cover his loss of sight. The young men took
to him at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a few preliminary remarks, Tom
launched into the object of their visit. He told
him that he and a few of his friends had decided
to go into an oil venture, and were looking about
for a likely spot to commence operations. They
had selected the Copperhead district and had
noted that his farm was right in the center of
the producing field. Did Mr. Goby care to sell
or lease all or part of his property? If he did,
Tom thought they might make a deal, as he and
his associates were prepared to offer perfectly
fair terms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The blind man listened attentively, though, for
a time, the boys could not tell whether interestedly
or not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said he, “it seems highly probable
that oil abounds on this farm of mine. All my
friends have told me so, and the fact that rich
strikes have been made all around it seems to
confirm the probability. Then, too, I’ve had a
number of offers from speculators and prospectors.
One group in particular have been especially
pressing. A man named Thompson with
two of his friends have seemed very anxious to
make some arrangement. But—” here Mr.
Goby hesitated for a moment—“perhaps it isn’t
fair to say so, but there’s something about them
that doesn’t seem to ring quite true. What they
offer sounds fair enough, but, somehow, I don’t
quite feel as though I could trust them. My
daughter, Carol, who is pretty shrewd, feels the
same way about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see,” murmured Tom, nodding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” continued Mr. Goby, after some
further talk concerning the offer Tom was prepared
to make, “I’m at a disadvantage on account
of my blindness. So I have to leave most
of my business affairs in the hands of an old
friend of mine, Judge Wilson, of the district
court. I’ve referred this Mr. Thompson and his
partners to the judge, but for some reason or
other they seem reluctant to deal with him.
They say that I’m the owner of the property,
and they’d rather deal direct with me than
through my attorney. But how can I sign
papers that I haven’t read? To be sure, my
daughter could read them to me, but even then
I’m not versed in legal matters, and there might
be some clause in the contract that would seem
perfectly innocent and yet be used to rob me.
This farm is all I have in the world, and I have
to look out for the future of my daughter.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span><h1>CHAPTER XVII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>CLOSING THE DEAL</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>You are</span> perfectly right, Mr. Goby,” declared
Tom. “Men who refuse to submit a contract
to a lawyer are to be distrusted on general principles.
No honest man would object. As far
as myself and my associates are concerned, we
are ready, with your approval, to submit our
proposition to Judge Wilson and have him draw
up the papers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That sounds fair,” replied the blind man.
“If you like, I’ll have my daughter telephone to
the judge and ask him to come over to-morrow.
By the way, where are you stopping in town?”
Mr. Goby had taken a liking to the boys, both
so frank and friendly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, the fact is,” answered Tom, “we
haven’t made any arrangements yet. We just
reached here to-day and came right over. We’ll
have to fix that up when we go back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t need to do anything in a rush,”
said Mr. Goby heartily. “We have plenty of
room here, and maybe we could let you stay with
us, especially if we come to a deal to work the
farm for oil. You might stay to-night, if you
care to.” And so, a little later, with Carol’s
consent, it was arranged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seem to be mighty nice people, Ned,”
remarked Tom, after the young inventor and his
chum had been shown to a room where they
might wash and make themselves otherwise
presentable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are right, Tom; and I hope we come to
a satisfactory arrangement with them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be great to strike something big
down here, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we mustn’t let our imagination run
away with us. We’ll have to take what comes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had an excellent supper, prepared by
Carol with the assistance of an old colored
mammy, and a very delightful evening, spent
chiefly by Tom in conversation with Mr. Goby,
whom he found to be well informed and an entertaining
talker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned had developed a sudden interest in flowers,
and was very anxious to have Carol show
him her garden. She was not unwilling, for this
handsome young man who seemed to have
dropped down on them from the skies was not
an unwelcome visitor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Carol’s a beautiful name,” murmured Ned
later that night, as he and Tom were getting
ready for bed in the comfortable room to which
they had been shown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom stopped in his work of unlacing a shoe
and stared at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sounds like the singing of birds,” mused
Ned dreamily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the love of Pete!” cried Tom, “what’s
the matter with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” said Ned in some confusion, “did I say
anything? Guess I must have been thinking out
loud.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day Judge Wilson came over to the
farm. He was a keen, cultivated man of high
standing in the legal profession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Swift,” he repeated, when he was introduced
to Tom. “That’s a famous name. Any relation
to the inventor, Tom Swift?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom flushed with embarrassment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A slight relation,” put in Ned, with a laugh.
“In fact, he’s the man himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you’re only a boy, lad!” exclaimed the
judge, in wonderment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Old enough to have a number of good inventions
to his credit,” affirmed Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m amazed!” cried the judge, when finally
convinced that the boy before him was the noted
inventor, Tom Swift. “Well, well, this is indeed
an honor! I’ve heard a lot about your
wonderful inventions—who hasn’t?—but I never
expected to have the pleasure of shaking you by
the hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a matter of fact, the recognition stood
Tom in good stead. It simplified matters immensely.
His standing was established at once,
and the tedious delay otherwise necessary in looking
up his references was obviated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were deep in the discussion of terms,
when Ned, who happened to be facing the window,
saw an automobile coming up the road. It
stopped at the gate and three men got out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned gave a low whistle of surprise as he recognized
them, and Tom and the judge looked
up inquiringly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hankinshaw and his partners,” explained
Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Friends of yours?” asked the judge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” replied Ned. “We’ve known them
chiefly in a business way. We——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Further explanations were prevented by a
knock on the door. Carol opened it and ushered
the three men into the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blank surprise showed in the faces of all of
them when they caught sight of Tom and Ned,
who had risen on their entrance. The blank
looks were quickly succeeded by looks of intense
vexation. Thompson and Bragden, as the more
diplomatic of the trio, banished these promptly,
but Hankinshaw’s brows remained drawn together
in a forbidding scowl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is an unexpected pleasure,” said Thompson
suavely, as the visitors seated themselves.
“Who would have thought that you were down
in this part of the country? On a little pleasure
trip, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More business than pleasure,” answered Tom
coolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Looking for contracts to make some more
oil-well machinery?” asked Bragden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” returned Tom. “Though if any came
our way we might consider them. We’re going
to do a little digging on our own account.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In this neighborhood?” asked Thompson,
looking with alarm at the papers that lay on the
table near Judge Wilson’s elbow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” replied Tom, who was getting a little
impatient at this cross-examination. “Right on
this farm, if Mr. Goby and I can come to
terms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cutting in under us, eh?” snarled Hankinshaw.
“Poaching on our preserves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That remark is quite uncalled for,” remarked
Judge Wilson, entering the conversation for the
first time since the introduction. “Why do you
use the phrase ‘our preserves’? These gentlemen
have no option or claim of any kind on the
property, have they, Mr. Goby?” he continued,
turning to the blind man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all,” replied the owner of the farm.
“They have discussed the matter with me several
times, but no agreement has been reached.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No written agreement perhaps,” broke in
Thompson. “But I certainly thought that we
had reached a verbal agreement, or at least a
practical understanding the last time we were
over here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I thought,” said Bragden, backing
up his partner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure we did,” growled Hankinshaw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing of the kind,” returned Mr. Goby indignantly.
“That is wholly your own assumption.
I distinctly told you then, as I had told
you before, that you would have to take the matter
up with Judge Wilson and that I would do
nothing without his approval.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The judge looked at the three men keenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have always been within easy reach,” he
remarked. “May I ask why you have not
brought the matter to my attention?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our plan has always been to save expense
and delay by dealing directly with the owners
of property,” replied Thompson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even when that owner happens to be a blind
man?” asked the judge, with a tinge of sarcasm
in his tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His daughter could read the papers to him,”
replied Thompson defensively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A blind man and an inexperienced young
girl,” mused Judge Wilson, and before the contempt
expressed, Thompson and Bragden winced,
while Hankinshaw glared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you give me authority to deal with these
gentlemen, Mr. Goby?” asked the judge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Absolutely,” returned the blind man. “Whatever
you say or do will be wholly satisfactory
to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That being the case, gentlemen,” said the
judge, turning to the three partners, “I think
we will not detain you any longer. You are
doubtless busy men and have many things to attend
to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a clear case of dismissal. Thompson
fumed white with anger, as he and Bragden rose
from their chairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may regret this,” said Thompson threateningly,
moving toward the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Possibly,” replied Judge Wilson indifferently,
turning toward his papers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You bet you will,” bullied Hankinshaw, who
remained obstinately planted in his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom sprang to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Goby,” he said, “would you mind stepping
from the room for a moment?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young girl vanished through a door at the
back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom went to the front door and threw it open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just to save Mr. Hankinshaw the trouble,”
he remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go when I get ready,” snarled Hankinshaw,
who was fighting mad at the collapse of
his scheme. “I’ll——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stopped short as the gigantic form of
Koku blocked the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in, Koku,” said Tom. “By the way,
Hankinshaw, you remember Koku, don’t you?
You met him the night that you couldn’t sleep.
He’s a genial sort of fellow, and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Hankinshaw at the sight of Koku had
risen from his chair with alacrity and followed
his partners from the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they had gone, Tom and Ned and the
judge got down to business, and it was not long
before they had settled on terms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom had agreed previously with Ned and Mr.
Damon that they would go into the oil venture
as partners with equal investments and equal
profits or losses. And the terms that were made
with Mr. Goby were not only fair, but generous.
He was to receive a large lump sum at once for
the privilege accorded Tom and his partners of
drilling on his farm. If the venture failed, he
would still have the farm and a large sum of
money. If oil were struck, he was to have a
good share of the profits. So that either way
he would win.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the contract signed, Tom and Ned set to
work. Through the aid of Judge Wilson, they
were able to secure the services of experienced
and reliable drillers. Much of their material had
already arrived, and other necessaries were secured
from the owners of abandoned wells in the
vicinity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a surprisingly short time, a derrick was
rigged, the machinery installed, and all was ready
for the venture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” said Tom, on the morning they
started work, as he patted lovingly his new patent
drill, “don’t fall down on me. Show me
what you can do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While he was busy with these preparations,
Tom had not come across any of the Hankinshaw
crowd, but from various sources he heard
that they were furious at their failure to get
hold of the Goby farm and that they were making
dire threats of getting even. But he was
too busy to pay any attention to these. He felt
perfectly confident of his ability to take care of
himself no matter what they might do. Not so
Mr. Damon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ll be after us, Tom,” said the eccentric
man, one day, and his manner showed his
nervousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You bet they’ll be after us,” put in Ned.
“Especially if we strike oil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll keep our eyes trimmed for them,” answered
the young inventor. “For Hankinshaw
especially,” he added soberly. He had seen a
look in that rascal’s eyes that proved the unscrupulous
fellow was becoming desperate.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span><h1>CHAPTER XVIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A TEST OF COURAGE</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>At first</span> the well went down rapidly. The
earth was soft and sandy near the surface, and
with even an ordinary drilling outfit progress
would have been fairly rapid. But Tom’s newly
perfected drill fairly ate its way through the soil,
“like a gimlet going through a nice soft piece of
cheese,” as Ned expressed it. They were all
delighted with the performance of the new invention,
and promised themselves an early and
successful strike.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this rapid progress did not keep up long.
After the first hundred feet or so, the ground
became harder, and they often encountered rocks
that slowed up even Tom’s marvelous drill. It
kept hammering away, though, and gradually
thrust through obstacles that would have splintered
and shattered any ordinary well-boring
outfit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Deeper and deeper grew the hole, and heavier
and heavier grew the pipe as it was sunk through
the earth’s crust. The big derrick creaked and
groaned, and they had to stop drilling for several
days while they added massive beams to the
structure to reënforce it. Then drilling was resumed,
but as the shaft sank deeper and deeper,
and still with no sign of oil, one member after
another of the party began to get discouraged.
At first they would hardly admit this, even to
themselves, but at last the facts had to be faced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Damon had arrived a few days before the
strengthening of the derrick. At first he had
been his usual bright and voluble self, but as
day followed day even his good spirits died away,
and at length he put in words what the others
had been thinking for some time past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my oil cups, Tom, I’m the last man in
the world to want to discourage you, but it begins
to look to me as though there wasn’t a drop
of oil on this whole farm—except what they burn
in the lamps at night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must admit that it begins to look that way,
as you say,” Tom replied. “But don’t forget
that more than once oil has been struck at greater
depths than we’ve penetrated so far. Why,
we’re not down a thousand feet yet, and the famous
‘spouter’ well didn’t break until they’d
gone down to nearly fourteen hundred. Besides,
we’ve struck a softer stratum of earth now, and
the old drill is beginning to bite through in fine
style once more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That new drill of yours has done wonders,
and if you let it go I think it would reach China
eventually, but even then it might not strike an
oil deposit. Why, bless my good, muscular right
arm, if you go down much farther, you’ll have
to strengthen your derrick again. A thousand
feet of iron pipe weighs something, let me tell
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if the derrick breaks, we’ll build a new
one,” returned Tom, doggedly. “I’ve got a
hunch that there’s oil under this farm, and I
want pretty good proof that there isn’t before I
give up looking for it. Besides, it isn’t only
ourselves that we’ve got to think of. Can’t you
imagine how disappointed Mr. Goby and his
daughter would be if we had to admit failure?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and then there’s the Hankinshaw gang,
too,” chimed in Ned. “They’d have the laugh
on us good and plenty if we went to all this
trouble and then didn’t get anything after all.
We’d just be saving them the expense of doing
the work themselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very true. But you’ve got to look at this
from a business viewpoint,” came from Mr.
Damon. “Every ten feet you go deeper now
will cost you many times more than the same distance
did at first, and if the chances seem all
against you, it’s better policy to take your losses
and get out while you’ve got something left.
That blessed hunch of yours, Tom, may prove
to be a very expensive one before you’re
through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s very true, Mr. Damon. But remember
that it hasn’t cost us nearly as much to drill
this hole as it would if we had reached the same
depth with the ordinary drilling equipment. I
think we’d better add a little more bracing to the
derrick and drill through another hundred feet
or so. If we don’t strike oil here, I want to feel
that we did our best, anyway. There may be
oil within ten feet of the drill point right now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom’s confidence and eagerness were infectious,
and while Mr. Damon still shook his head
doubtfully and blessed everything he could think
of, it was finally decided to “carry on” a little
while longer. Ned, while still unconvinced, did
not advance any further arguments against a continuation
of the drilling, as he knew how bitterly
disappointed Carol would be if they failed in the
undertaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Day followed day at the scene of the drilling,
and still there was the same heartbreaking lack
of success. Deeper and deeper went the drill,
faster now, but still with no result. Finally their
supply of pipe ran out, and it was almost a week
before they could get more—a week during
which Tom paced restlessly about the confines
of the farm, counting the minutes until they
could resume operations. The time was not entirely
wasted, however, as they added some heavy
shoring to the derrick, together with some new
crossbeams to support those that were bending
and splitting under the tremendous strain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In drilling for oil, as the drill bores a hole
through the earth’s crust, lengths of wrought-iron
pipe are lowered into the hole to keep the
earth from caving in and filling the shaft. When
one length of pipe, usually twelve to fifteen feet,
is all the way in, another length is coupled on to
it, and this in turn is sunk as the drill goes deeper.
Now, the entire weight of this pipe is supported
by a wooden—or, in some cases, steel—framework,
which is erected over the boring. One
length of four-inch pipe is not such a trifling
weight, and when dozens of these lengths are
coupled together, their combined weight becomes
enormous. Quite often the pipe or its supports
will break, and then the whole length drops down
into the hole and has to be fished out again before
operations can be resumed. This is often
a very difficult job, and may hold up progress
for many days. In the feverish rush to get the
shaft sunk, derricks are often overloaded until
they fall under the strain, often badly injuring
or killing the workmen, and in any event causing
delay and expense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom and his friends had guarded as far as
possible against these accidents, and so far had
had no trouble in that direction. But with every
length of pipe that was added to that already
in the hole, the chance of an accident grew
greater.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, Tom, with characteristic grit, had
determined to see the enterprise through to a
finish, and the others of the party, seeing that
he was not to be dissuaded, concealed as far as
possible their own despondency as to the outcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my suspenders, Tom Swift, you look
as though you had lost your last friend!” exclaimed
Mr. Damon, one day. “The world
won’t come to an end just because we’ve happened
to run out of pipe. We’ll have more in
a few days, and in the meantime you ought to
be getting a rest instead of pacing up and down
like a wild animal in its cage. You’ll make
yourself sick if you don’t look out—bless my pill
box, but you will!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll get well fast enough when we strike oil,”
Tom assured him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When we strike oil! Bless my timepiece!
What about now? Now, Tom Swift?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom laughed, but merely reiterated that he
would be well enough when the oil began to
flow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right. But in the meantime, why
not be sociable?” came from Ned, as he linked
his arm with that of his friend “You take hold
of him on the other side, Mr. Damon, and we’ll
trot him up to the farmhouse and give him a
good home-cooked meal. In other words, we’ll
feed the brute.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>ON THE VERGE</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>In the</span> big comfortable kitchen of the farmhouse
a delicious supper was being prepared and
Carol was busily engaged in setting the good
things on the table when Tom, Ned and Mr.
Damon entered. She had seen them coming, but
had immediately retreated from the window
when she saw Ned looking in her direction, and
now tried to pretend that she had not been on
the lookout at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mr. Damon was not inclined to let her off
so easily. Although he had known the Gobys
but a few days, the jovial and eccentric man already
seemed like an old friend of the family,
and was very popular with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought I saw you at the window, Carol,
as we came along,” he said with a mischievous
twinkle in his eye. “Were you looking for any
one in particular?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not at all. I just happened to glance
out, and there you were coming along. You
all looked hungry, too, so I thought I’d better
hurry and serve supper,” she answered demurely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the meal, Mr. Goby dropped something
of his usual sad manner and became talkative.
He told them of many interesting incidents in
the surrounding country, for which he entertained
a deep affection, and predicted great things
in the future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The country is rich any way you look at it,”
he proclaimed, after they had left the table and
were in the living room. “If your land is fertile,
you can make money out of raising crops
and cattle on the surface, and if it’s barren you
stand a good chance of finding riches under the
surface. My son always used to say that you
were bound to do well with it one way or the
other, and I guess he was right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my posterity!” cried Mr. Damon.
“Your son? Why, I didn’t know you had a boy.
Neither you nor Carol has ever mentioned him.
Tell us about him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Damon was all interest, as were also the
others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” replied Mr. Goby. “I have a son,
and a fine big fellow he is. But he hasn’t been
home for a long time now. He hasn’t even written
lately. I guess he must have forgotten his
father and sister,” and there was a note of sadness
and longing in the blind man’s voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes the young people get so interested
in the outside world that they don’t realize how
long the time seems to the folks at home,” said
Mr. Damon sympathetically. “What is your
boy doing, Mr. Goby?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just what worries me more than anything
else. He’s gone fairly crazy over airplanes,
and the last we heard of him he was flying
one for some inventor who was developing
a new type. I’m afraid that he may have met
with some accident, and that’s why we haven’t
heard from him for so long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, flying in an airplane is safe enough,”
remarked Tom. “I’ve traveled a good many
thousands of miles that way and never got anything
worse than a scratch to show for it. What
is your son’s first name, Mr. Goby? I may have
heard of him somewhere. Or if I don’t know
him myself, I have a wide acquaintance among
flying men and can make some inquiries among
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s an unusual name,” replied the blind man.
“But it’s one that his grandfather carried before
him, and so we gave it to him. His full name
is Hitt Goby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hitt Goby,” Tom repeated, with a puzzled
look on his face. “I don’t think I ever heard
the name before, and yet there is something familiar
about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Same here,” remarked Ned. “Hitt Goby.
Hitt Goby. Say, Tom,” he added, with sudden
excitement, “do you suppose it could be the aviator
we rescued in the woods? You know we
thought he said his name was Hillobie, but he
was half unconscious and it might have been Hitt
Goby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By George, I believe you’re right!” replied
Tom, jumping to his feet in great excitement
and beginning to pace the room. “We’ll have to
wire to Shopton right away and find out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my shoe laces!” gasped Mr. Damon,
and then sat staring about him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean? What happened to my
son?” demanded the blind man, in great agitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had risen to his feet and stood trembling,
his face the color of ashes. Tom sprang to his
side and supported him as he swayed dizzily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said that he was half unconscious when
you rescued him,” cried Carol, sudden tears in
her eyes. “How did he get hurt? How badly
was he hurt? Oh, tell us quickly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be frightened,” said Ned quietly, taking
her hand. “He wasn’t fatally hurt. He was
getting along all right the last time we saw him.
Perhaps, after all, it wasn’t your brother. Have
you a picture of him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” replied Carol, her first apprehensions
relieved by what Ned said. “I have one up on
my bureau. I’ll run up and get it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She flew upstairs, and a moment later returned
with the photograph. It had evidently been
taken some years before, but the likeness was
undeniable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the man,” declared Tom, after a moment’s
inspection. Ned, who was looking over
his shoulder, nodded in agreement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No doubt about it. Same eyes, same nose,
same shaped head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell us all about it,” cried Mr. Goby and
Carol in the same breath, feverish with impatience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In as few words as possible, Tom narrated
the happenings of that memorable afternoon
when the young aviator had fallen into the woods
with his blazing plane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Broken leg! Broken ribs! My poor brother!”
cried Carol, and, for a moment, her tears flowed,
while Mr. Goby only by the greatest effort kept
himself from following her example.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he’s gotten all over those troubles,” Tom
assured them consolingly. “The last time I saw
the head physician of the hospital he told me
that both leg and ribs had healed perfectly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t thank you two young men enough for
what you have done for my poor boy,” said Mr.
Goby, and Carol’s eyes were bright with unspoken
thanks through her tears. “But if he
has got well again, why hasn’t he left the hospital
and come home? And why hasn’t he
written?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was a poser for Tom, who had carefully
avoided saying anything about Hitt Goby’s mental
condition. That, he felt, would be almost
equivalent to a death blow. He almost began to
regret that the matter had been mentioned at
all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, there might be a dozen reasons for either
of those things,” he said evasively. “In the first
place, they might keep him at the hospital even
after the breaks had mended until he had fully
gotten back his strength. But I’ll tell you what
I’ll do. I’ll telegraph the first thing to-morrow
morning from Copperhead to the hospital and
find out just how matters stand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing else was talked of that night, and the
boys had to answer questions bearing on every
little detail of the young aviator’s rescue. They
glossed over their own part of the work as much
as possible, but Mr. Goby and Carol overwhelmed
them with thanks for the part they had
played.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom and Ned had heavy hearts, however,
when at last they found themselves alone in their
room. They looked at each other gloomily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can we ever tell them if it turns out
that the boy has lost his mind?” groaned Tom,
in a whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In that case, it would be a thousand times
better if he were dead,” responded Ned gloomily.
“But we’ve got to buck up and hope for the best.
It’s a good while since we saw him, and by this
time he’ll perhaps be all right in mind as well
as body. At any rate, we’ll know by to-morrow
night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first thing after breakfast the next morning,
Tom, in the <span class='it'>Winged Arrow</span>, flew over to
Copperhead. There he dispatched a telegram to
Dr. Sherwood, asking him to tell him the whole
truth, whether the news was good or bad, about
young Goby’s condition, and to wire him, if possible,
so that he could get the message by noon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had a considerable amount of business to
transact in Copperhead, and he was glad that he
had, as it occupied the time and made the waiting
more endurable. But by noon he was back
in the telegraph station, only to be told that no
message had come for him. He waited around
for nearly an hour, fairly consumed with impatience.
But at last the operator looked up
from his clicking key.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something for you coming in now, Mr.
Swift,” he announced. “I’ll have it all in a
minute or two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom hastened over and watched him as he
transcribed the message and handed it to him.
Tom glanced over it and let out a whoop of exultation
that made the operator smile. Then he
rushed out and jumped into the plane and sent
it whizzing over to the Goby farm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carol had been on the watch for him, and
came running out of the house to the open space
where he made his landing. A glance at his
face told her that he was the bearer of good tidings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had it been anything of less importance, Tom
might have teased her a little before he told her.
As it was, he thrust the yellow slip in her hand
as soon as he reached her side. She read it
eagerly, pressed it to her heart, and then, with
a word of thanks, hurried to the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right, Father!” she cried, as she burst!
into the living room, where the blind man was
eagerly awaiting her. “Listen to this!” And
with hands that trembled so that she could hardly
hold the paper she read:</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“Young Goby entirely recovered. Body and
mind in perfect condition. Will leave the hospital
in a day or two and go directly to his
father’s home.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>Sherwood.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The blind man opened his arms and Carol
sank into them, father and daughter weeping
happy tears together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom had not followed Carol, for he knew that
just then she wanted no other company than her
father. He hunted up Ned and Mr. Damon and
imparted the good news to them, and they had a
little jubilee of their own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the well, however, things were not going
so happily. The new supply of pipe and
couplings had arrived, and Tom had started the
drill again, but still they seemed as far as ever
from oil. For two days more the drill aid
steadily down, and length after length of pipe
was engulfed in the deepening hole. They had
now penetrated the earth’s crust to a distance of
1,300 feet without a sign of oil, and any one with
less than Tom’s indomitable courage would have
quit the seemingly hopeless struggle in weariness
and disgust. But Tom was not yet ready
to acknowledge himself beaten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll go down another hundred feet,” he
said, while Mr. Damon shook his head and even
Ned looked gloomy and downcast. “I know we
can’t go on forever, and if we don’t strike oil in
the next hundred feet I’ll own up that we’re
beaten and we’ll have to make the best of it.
Fourteen hundred feet will be our limit. And I
guess that won’t be so bad, even if we don’t reach
oil. We can say we died game, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, bless my eyes and ears, Tom Swift, I
must say I have more admiration for your grit
than for your judgment,” cried Mr. Damon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he had taken my advice and stopped two
weeks ago, think of all the money we’d have
saved, not to mention the time and worry. I
think we’re foolish to go another hundred feet,”
grumbled Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I know that if his heart is set on it,
nothing we can say will change him, Ned,” resumed
Mr. Damon. “I wish you luck, my boy,”
he went on, turning to Tom. “But it looks dark
and dreary to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ll stick it out, anyway,” replied Tom
doggedly. “The drill is going fast now, and it
won’t take us more than a few days at most to
go that extra hundred. I’ll promise to quit then,
but not an inch sooner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This conversation took place just before the
men knocked off work at noontime. They were
a disgruntled crew, for they had all set their
hearts on striking a “gusher,” and were almost
as downcast over the prospect of failure as Ned
and Mr. Damon. After lunch they gathered
around to resume work in a mechanical manner,
and Tom could easily see that they had given up
hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The drill was set in operation once more. It
had been going only a short time. Suddenly a
far-off rumbling sound came up the shaft. At
the same time a pungent odor of raw petroleum
came drifting out of the boring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a second all was wild excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re close to oil, sir!” exclaimed the foreman
of the drilling gang. “A few more strokes
of the drill, and we’ll be through into it. Better
be ready to cap the well before we go any
farther.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom was about to issue the necessary orders,
when suddenly, deep under the earth’s surface,
there was an explosion that rocked the solid
ground on which they stood! From the boring
came a whistling sound, resembling the escape
of steam under high pressure!</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span><h1>CHAPTER XX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>CAPPING THE GUSHER</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>For a</span> moment the men about the well stared
at one another in silent consternation. Then,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Watch yourselves!” yelled the foreman.
“There’s oil coming, and coming fast! Get the
capping rigging ready, men, and move lively!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hissing sound grew louder. Suddenly the
drill came hurtling out of the well, impelled by
the tremendous pressure behind it, and shot
through the heavy beams of the derrick as
though they had been cardboard. Following the
drill came a shower of sand and small stones.
Those about the well were forced to race for
shelter until the last of the debris had been blown
out by the force of the escaping gas and the
shower ceased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the men came racing back, bringing with
them the valve and clamps that were to be used
to cap the well after the oil started to flow. As
yet, nothing had come from the well but gas,
but they knew the oil could not be far off. Under
the terrific pressure of the outflowing gas, the
heavy derrick began to crumble, and in a short
time the whole upper part of it came apart and
the stout timbers were whirled aloft and scattered
far and wide like so many matchsticks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hissing grew louder, and a heavy rumbling
sound vibrated along the pipe line, growing
steadily louder and more menacing. In a few
minutes more this sound had reached a huge
crescendo, and then, with a shriek like that of
an imprisoned demon liberated, the oil reached
the surface and shot a hundred feet into the air
in a huge, writhing black geyser that flared out
at the top and deluged everything within a radius
of hundreds of feet with raw glistening petroleum.
As the oil fell, it rapidly collected into
large pools, and started running off in every direction
where there was a slight slope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a few seconds after the tremendous fountain
started, Tom stood almost petrified by the
magnitude of the spectacle. But the sight of the
precious oil running to waste in such huge quantities
galvanized Ned and Mr. Damon into action.
Mr. Damon danced around, wild with excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my oil drill!” he shouted. “We’ve
struck it! We’ve struck it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That wonderful drill of yours has done the
trick!” cried Ned, wringing his friend’s hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve got the oil,” said Tom, who, though
pale with excitement, still kept his head. “The
thing to do now is to save it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The capping outfit with which they hoped to
stem the tremendous force of the gusher was of
a special design that Tom had worked out. It
consisted of an extra heavy gate valve set in a
cast steel framework, with heavy steel clamps for
holding the entire assembly to the end of the
well pipe. In addition to the actual valve and
holding mechanism, Tom had contrived an ingenious
screw mechanism with which to place
the valve over the stream of oil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get busy with that valve,” shouted Tom, his
voice rising high above the din.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was no easy task. In many similar wells,
attempts had been made to imprison the oil with
heavy timber boxes and framework, but the force
of the oil stream is so great that these devices
were usually shot up bodily into the air, and only
came down in the form of kindling wood.
Tom knew this, and in designing his capping
mechanism had placed his reliance on steel as
being the material best suited to withstand the
strain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the time had come when his mechanism
was to be put to the test. The riggers soon had
the valve and clamping framework as close to the
well as they could get, also the sliding carriage,
with its rails bolted to concrete foundations that
had been prepared for it previously. Everything
was now ready for the test, and in feverish excitement
they prepared to move the valve over
the well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Steady, men, steady!” shouted Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The spray of oil and vapor was so dense near
the well that it was impossible to get closer than
about twenty-five feet and breathe. As it was,
every man of the party was soaked and drenched
with the clinging oil. Their clothes hung limply
about them, and were so saturated and heavy that
it was difficult for them even to move.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep your heads, boys,” cautioned Tom, who
was now as cool and self-possessed as ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom had foreseen that his apparatus would
have to be worked at some distance from the
well, and he had provided a long handle made
of piping, which was connected to the screw
mechanism. Now the foreman and several of
his men began to turn the screw, and the valve
moved slowly toward the roaring, spouting
stream of oil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed almost incredible that any mechanism
devised by man could withstand that tremendous
force. Some of the men actually expected
to see the heavy steel castings bent and
broken as easily as a man would snap a stick
across his knee. But Tom’s designing had been
thorough, and he had personally superintended
the construction of the mechanism from his
plans. Everything was extra heavy and of the
best obtainable quality, as it had need to be for
such an undertaking as this. When the valve
reached the casing, it held true to its place, and
the shaft of oil was diverted slightly to one side.
The men held their breath as with anxious eyes
they followed the progress of the valve across
the casing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly but steadily the drilling crew turned
at the screw, slowly the valve moved onward
over the casing. The stream of oil roared and
hissed as it writhed and twisted about this obstacle,
and seemed to be trying to tear it bodily
from its anchors. A heavy spray filled the air,
and although the men at the screw were half-browned
in oil, they stuck gamely to their post.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Farther and farther the column of oil bent,
smashing against the steel that barred its path
as though determined to destroy it by the force
of its mighty onrush. Inexorably the heavy steel
carriage, man’s challenge to nature’s might,
moved onward, as steady, unhurried, and invincible
as fate itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the column of oil was deflected at an
acute angle, farther and farther, until suddenly
it divided into two columns, one roaring straight
upward again through the valve, while the other
was deflected more and more toward the horizontal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s working all right!” cried Ned exultantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seems to be,” agreed Tom, watching like a
hawk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gradually the vertical stream, thin at first,
became thicker and heavier, and the other stream
grew thinner, until finally the entire shaft of oil
was roaring and rushing through the open valve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom and Ned shouted and cheered, while Mr.
Damon blessed everything he could think of.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my dividends!” he cried. “Tom, my
boy, you’re a wonder-worker, a magician!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew you’d do it, old boy!” exclaimed Ned,
as he clapped his chum on the shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It does look as though we’d won out,” admitted
Tom, less exuberant but no less excited
than his friends. “But now let’s see if the valve
will hold when we close it. The pressure is going
to be something fierce.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The drillers were hardly less elated, and
shouted and pounded each other unmercifully.
Then they fell to work again, and soon everything
was ready for closing the valve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom had made another long handle to connect
with the wheel of the valve, but he was too impatient
to wait for this to be used. Drawing a
long breath, he dashed through the spray of oil
close to the well and started turning the hand
wheel that operated the gate valve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From a circular column, the shaft of oil assumed
a crescent shape, growing narrower as
the gate closed. Thinner and thinner grew the
stream, until at length the valve was entirely
closed. Then there came a tense moment of
waiting. With the tremendous pressure of the
imprisoned oil backing up against it, would the
valve mechanism stand the strain? Would the
framework supporting the valve hold?</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE INQUISITIVE STRANGER</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Every man</span> stood tense, eyes riveted on the
valve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Attached to the lower part of the capping
mechanism was a pressure gauge. As the valve
closed, the needle of the gauge began creeping
steadily around the dial. When the valve was
completely closed, the pressure mounted steadily.
Five hundred—six—seven hundred pounds to
the square inch, and still the needle moved around
the dial. When it finally came to rest, it indicated
a confined or “rock” pressure in the well
of nine hundred and fifty pounds per square
inch!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will she hold?” asked Ned anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Five minutes will tell,” answered Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom had designed his capping mechanism with
a generous allowance for overload, and he had
no fear of failure, but to the others it seemed
incredible that anything could withstand such a
tremendous pressure. But as the first anxious
moments of waiting passed and nothing happened,
their tense nerves relaxed and they ventured
to draw long breaths again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom and Ned and Mr. Damon shook hands
solemnly, and then in turn shook hands with the
drilling boss and each member of the crew.
Then, as every man was almost exhausted with
his strenuous efforts and the well was safely
brought in and capped, all work was discontinued
for the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guess we’ll call it a day,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the best day’s work you’ve ever done!”
exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my shower bath!” cried Mr. Damon.
“We’re as black as coal heavers. Better go and
clean up. And these clothes of ours are done
for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guess we can afford to buy others now that
we’re oil magnates,” chuckled Tom happily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The roar of the gusher had been heard for
miles around, and in a few hours people were
coming from every direction to view the new
“strike.” Automobiles, wagons, and buggies
came in a constant stream to the Goby farmhouse,
and thence to the scene of the drilling.
Veteran oil men were amazed to find the new
well already capped, and had it not been for the
pools of petroleum and the dripping trees in the
vicinity, they would have doubted that oil had
really been struck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Usually when oil is struck a week or more 13
spent in designing and making a capping device,
while the oil runs to waste, or, at best, is partially
reclaimed by pumping it out of the hollows
where it has collected. Tom had steered clear
of this folly, and when the emergency came he
was properly equipped to meet it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doubts of the visitors were soon dissipated,
especially after they viewed the pressure
gauge, which now indicated nine hundred
and seventy-five pounds to the square
inch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can she stand it?” was the question on every
lip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom himself was somewhat worried over this
mounting pressure, as he knew that if it kept increasing
indefinitely no mechanism could withstand
its force. But the pressure never went
higher than nine hundred and seventy-eight
pounds, and when they later got the well to delivering
oil regularly, it dropped somewhat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The news of the strike soon spread beyond
the neighboring towns, got into the papers, and
became a subject of nation-wide interest. Newspapers
published front-page stories of the new
gusher, and in a few days there was a rush of
speculators and “wildcatters” from all over the
country. There were also many representatives
and buyers from big oil companies, who were
anxious to buy the Goby farm at almost any figure,
and also the adjoining land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom, Mr. Damon and Ned, however, had not
been idle in the days following the strike, and
they had quietly bought up large tracts of land,
on most of which they had had options before
oil was discovered. They sold out a few of the
smaller of these holdings, and received enough
from them to pay all the cost of the drilling and
leave a handsome sum besides.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day a keen-eyed business man separated
himself from the group of people who were usually
to be found about the well, drawn there by
the fascination that always attaches to an oil
strike, and introduced himself to Tom. The
card he tendered showed that he was the Texas
representative of one of the biggest oil companies
in the country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Struck it rich, I see,” he remarked, with a
smile. “From the way that well came in it
promises to be one of the biggest gushers in this
section. Let’s see, how long have you been
digging?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom mentioned the date on which he and his
companions had started work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” said the stranger, after a moment of
mental figuring, “then I gather that you must
have dug down four or five hundred feet before
you struck oil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More than that,” replied Tom. “Fourteen
hundred feet is nearer the figure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The newcomer looked bewildered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I must have misunderstood you as to
the time you started drilling,” he remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess not,” said Tom, repeating the same
date as before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” said the man. “I suppose you must
have worked in three shifts day and night,” he
added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Mr. Blythe,” replied Tom, with a glance
at the card he held in his hand. “We’ve had
only the ordinary day crew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” returned Mr. Blythe, “you must have
worked in softer soil than I knew was to be
found in this section of Texas. Perhaps you
didn’t come across rock of any account.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the contrary,” replied Tom, with secret
amusement, for he had fathomed the cause of
his interrogator’s perplexity, “my foreman tells
me that we had to bore through some of the most
stubborn rock that he has come across in his long
experience. And the specimens we brought up
confirm this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Blythe threw up his hands in a gesture of
amazement. Tom’s sincerity was apparent, but
what he said seemed incredible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I give it up!” he exclaimed. “According to
all precedent in this oil field, you couldn’t possibly
have gone down more than five hundred feet
at the outside in the time and under the conditions
you mention. What’s the answer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The answer is that in digging this well I’ve
used a drill hitherto unused—one of my own invention,”
replied Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In an instant Mr. Blythe was aflame with excitement.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>RAD TURNS UP</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>You invented</span> it yourself?” cried Mr. Blythe.
“And you’ve dug this well in a third of the time
that the ordinary drill requires? Why, Mr.
Swift, do you know that you have made one of
the most important inventions of this century?
Where is the drill? Can I look at it? Have you
patented it? Is it for sale? Are you open to a
proposition?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The questions came tumbling from him one
after the other in a way that showed plainly how
this astute business man had been shaken out of
his customary calm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His agitation helped to confirm Tom’s own
conviction that he possessed a fortune in his
drill. And since he had it, he was in no haste
to let it go to the first bidder. Others would
want it too, and he had determined to let them
bid against each other. He was not to be rushed
off his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t go into that now, Mr. Blythe,” he said.
“In the first place, I have my hands full in arranging
to get my oil to market. Then, in such
an important thing as the sale of my patent, if
I should determine to sell it, I must think things
over carefully.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Blythe urged and argued, but Tom was
not to be shaken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Promise me this then,” said Mr. Blythe at
last. “Promise that you won’t make any disposition
of it until I have had a chance to get in
touch with my company and they have had an
opportunity to make you an offer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t make promises,” replied Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not if I pay you a handsome sum down for
your promise to wait three days before you commit
yourself to any one else?” asked Mr. Blythe,
drawing out his checkbook from his pocket.
“That doesn’t put you under any obligation to
accept our offer. You can refuse that offer if
you like. It simply gives us three days’ time to
get in a bid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put up your checkbook, Mr. Blythe,” replied
Tom, with a friendly smile. “I don’t want to
be bound in any way. You’ve got the telegraph
and the long distance telephone at your disposal,
and you can communicate with your New York
office. When I have your actual offer in my
hand, if your people choose to make one, I promise
to give it fair and careful consideration.
Further than that I can’t go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baffled for the moment, Mr. Blythe bade Tom
a hasty farewell, jumped into his car, and put
off toward Copperhead at a speed that threatened
to break the laws. Tom looked after him
with a smile, and then turned to matters that
claimed his immediate attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned and Mr. Damon were interested and
amused when Tom told them that night of his
interview with Mr. Blythe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my prophetic powers!” cried Mr.
Damon. “I told you they’d all be crazy to get
hold of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let them worry,” said Ned, with a grin. “It
will be good for their souls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later Tom gave them a bit of news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m expecting Rad down here to-morrow or
next day,” he remarked. “It looks as though
we’d be in this part of the country for quite a
time now, and I thought I might as well let him
come along. In the last letter I had from Dad,
he said that Rad seemed miserable and didn’t
know what to do with himself. Said he was
making a nuisance of himself about the house.
So I wrote and told him to send him down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sure enough, the following day the old negro
arrived at the farm. Tom had looked for him
by a later train, and so there was no one to meet
Rad and he had walked the four miles from the
station. He was overjoyed at seeing Tom, and
showed every tooth in a glistening smile as his
young master met him at the gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dis sho’ am a sight fo’ sore eyes, Marse Tom,
it sho’ am! Seemed lak Ah wouldn’t nebber
git here, and den some fool niggah down in de
town give me de wrong directions, an’ Ah
thought Ah nebber would arrive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m mighty glad that you are here, Rad.
I felt sure that you’d like this better than loafing
around back home. How do you like the
little you’ve seen of this oil country?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cain’t say dat Ah t’inks much of it,” he replied,
with a gloomy shake of his kinky head.
“It seems powerful hilly and all dat, but Ah
reckon it cain’t be helped.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” laughed Tom. “These hills look as
though they had been put here to stay. But
there’s plenty to eat, and Mr. Goby’s daughter
is a good housekeeper and has a fine cook, so possibly
you’ll come to like it better after awhile.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dere’s nothin’ like havin’ plenty to eat,” declared
Rad, while his glistening countenance assumed
its usual happy expression. “Pears to
me Ah feels a bit hungry right now,” and he
looked hopefully at Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I imagine dinner will be ready in about an
hour, if you think you can survive that long,”
Tom informed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reckon Ah’ll have to stick it out some way,”
answered the colored man resignedly. “Wharat
am dis yere oil well, Marse Tom? Does you let
a bucket down into it an’ tote up some oil when
you needs it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not exactly,” answered Tom, with a grin.
“The hard thing to do with this well is to keep
the oil in. For some reason or other, it seems
very anxious to escape. It was spouting up a
hundred feet into the air the day we tapped
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rad rolled his eyes in astonishment, but was
too overcome to make any remark. When Tom
showed him the capped well he was visibly disappointed.
It is hard to say what he expected
to see, but evidently the quiet appearance of the
well did not impress him much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah thought dat dis yere well would be raisin’
all kinds o’ ructions, but it looks jest as peaceable
as kin be,” he observed. “A fool niggah down at
de depot tole me it made a noise dat a feller
could heah fo’ miles and miles, but Ah doan heah
even a whispah fum it. Reckon dat man mus’
have been jest a plain, ornary prevasticator.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The trouble is, you arrived too late, Rad.
You should have been here the day the well
started. But don’t let that worry you. There’s
apt to be plenty of noise and excitement around
here before we see Shopton once more. I heard
to-day that the Hankinshaw crowd is out after
our scalps, and we may have our hands full with
them before long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That Koku and Rad were glad to be reunited
goes without saying, though they were soon engaged
as lustily as ever in their vociferous but
harmless verbal battles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom had received word that morning from a
friend in Copperhead that the Hankinshaw gang
were furious over the news of his successful
strike, and had sworn to get even by hook or
crook. Tom was not sure that this warning
should be taken seriously, and yet it might be
well to be on his guard, so that afternoon he and
Mr. Damon and Ned had a conference to discuss
the matter. They decided that about all
they could do was to keep a wary eye out for
the first hostile move of their enemies, and trust
to outwitting them if they could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t exactly see what they could do,”
mused Ned thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, there’s always the possibility of
personal violence,” returned Tom. “I know
that Hankinshaw hates me like poison and he
wouldn’t weep any bitter tears if something happened
to me. But I’ve handled him before and
I can handle him again if he starts anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” faltered Ned. “But he’s slippery
and underhanded, and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He might not face you in the open,” put in
Mr. Damon anxiously. “There are a lot of desperate
characters hanging around every new oil
field, and he might hire some of them to do
what he wouldn’t dare to do himself. Be on your
guard, my boy. Hankinshaw is a man to be
reckoned with.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A DASTARDLY PLOT</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Hankinshaw was</span> indeed a man to be reckoned
with. He was of a sullen and revengeful
nature, and prided himself on always “getting
even” with any one who crossed his will. For
Tom and his friends he entertained an especially
bitter feeling, not only because of the clashes at
Shopton, but also because he had succeeded in persuading
himself that Tom had “double crossed”
him in getting the rights to the drilling on the
Goby farm. In reality, Tom had been moved
more by a desire to protect the blind man from
being swindled than by a wish for his own personal
gain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, as is common with men of his sort,
Hankinshaw judged Tom by his own warped and
twisted standards, and even before oil had been
struck on the Goby farm he was planning to have
revenge for the fancied injury. But when he
learned that Tom had actually struck a gusher,
his anger and chagrin knew no bounds. He saw
the riches that he had thought to pocket himself
going to others, and the sight drove him fairly
wild with rage. He immediately called his confederates
together, that they might plan some
way to bring about Tom’s downfall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They gathered in Hankinshaw’s room at the
hotel one evening about a week after the well had
been tapped. Hankinshaw’s partners were almost
as bitter as he over their loss of the big
gusher, and were prepared to follow him in any
enterprise that promised revenge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hankinshaw, as the more forceful, had taken
Thompson’s place as leader, and he was the one
who opened the conference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, boys, we’ve been done to the queen’s
taste,” he began, as he smoked his vile pipe furiously.
“That cub Tom Swift and his friends
have put the kibosh on us good and proper.
They’ve struck oil, and we’re left out in the cold
when we should be running that gusher ourselves
right now. That being the case, are we going to
take it lying down like dogs, or are we going to
hit back?” and he glanced from one to the other
with an ugly scowl on his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His companions shifted uneasily in their chairs
and looked at each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to hit back all right,” said Thompson.
“But all the same, I do not care to do anything
that may land me in jail. I’ve kept clear of that
so far, and I’m not anxious to begin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel the same way,” agreed Bragden. “It’s
better to be safe than sorry. All the same, Hankinshaw,
let’s know what you have in mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hankinshaw looked at them with a wicked
gleam in his close-set eyes. “I’m not so particular
as you fellows,” he sneered. “When a
man has done me an injury, I aim to get even
with him and I am none too squeamish as to how.
I do it. I’ve thought up a scheme that will do
the trick for us, and there is not enough risk in
it even to scare you pikers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cut out that rough stuff, Hankinshaw,” said
Thompson. “That isn’t going to get us anywhere.
Lay your cards on the table.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, then; here’s the dope. You both
know oil wells, and you know that when a gusher
comes in it spreads out over the landscape quite
considerable before it’s got under control, don’t
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They both nodded, and waited expectantly for
him to go on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you also know that if an oil well
gets afire, it’s a mighty hard thing to put it out,
don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again they nodded, while a gleam of comprehension
crept into their eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, now, the woods and grass are pretty
dry at this season of the year, and if one of us
happened to drop a match into the grass when
the wind was blowing toward the Goby farm, I
imagine the fire might travel real fast, especially
after it reached the oil-soaked belt around the
well. What do you think?” and he glanced
keenly at his accomplices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thompson considered for a moment, his brows
knitted in a malignant scowl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When it comes to planning, Hankinshaw,” he
said, “you’re there with the goods. If that well
could be set afire we will have taken a good long
step toward getting even, and I won’t feel so bad
about the money we have lost. But as far as
the actual work is concerned, count me out of it.
Get as many roughnecks together as you need,
and I’ll bear my share of the expense. I suppose
you feel the same way, Bragden?” he added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bragden nodded his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the way I feel about it,” he agreed.
“But when the thing happens, I am going to be
out of town. I’ll help bear whatever expense
there may be in carrying out the plan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave me to hold the bag, eh?” Hankinshaw
sneered. “Well, I didn’t expect anything else,”
he added. “You have always looked to me for
the rough stuff, but let it go at that. I’ll take
a chance; play a lone hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thompson and Bragden chose to ignore the
slur about their courage, and a conference followed
on ways and means. When the gathering
broke up it had been agreed that Hankinshaw’s
nefarious scheme should be put into effect
on the first night that conditions were favorable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All unaware of their enemies’ plotting, Tom
and his companions were exceedingly busy with
plans for getting the oil to market. They had
already ordered several miles of eight-inch pipe,
which they intended to run to Copperhead, the
nearest town on the railroad. The time of delivery
was uncertain, however, and until the pipe
arrived, there was not much that could be done
toward developing the well. They had secured
a right-of-way for the pipe line over the adjoining
farms, and were now anxious to get the oil
running.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It won’t take us very long to lay the line,
once we get the pipe,” remarked Tom. “If only
we had been absolutely sure that we were going
to strike oil, we could have ordered it months
ago, and had it here all ready and waiting now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my thick skull! that’s true, Tom,” exclaimed
Mr. Damon. “But none of us are
prophets, and eight-inch pipe isn’t the cheapest
thing in the world to buy. That’s one of the
things we simply had to let go until we knew
we had the oil to put through it. We don’t need
to worry, anyway. The main thing is that we’ve
got the oil, and a week or so’s delay won’t hurt
us. It will give us a chance to rest up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Luckily for Tom and his friends, they did not
have to have pumping stations, as their well was
on comparatively high ground, and there was a
continual slope from there to Copperhead. All
they had to do was to run their eight-inch pipe line
to the town and empty it into a concrete tank.
This tank had already been started several days
before, and they expected to have it completed
by the time they got the oil line connected up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Urgent telegraph and telephone calls hurried
up shipments of pipe, and in a few days it began
to come in. Tom directed the laying. The men
all liked the young inventor and worked willingly
and untiringly at his bidding, but at best it was
slow work getting those four miles of pipe laid.
In spite of his desire for speed, Tom would not
allow any careless work, and each joint had to
be made to his satisfaction before another could
be bolted up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They laid the pipe in shallow trenches and covered
it a few inches deep with dirt. Length after
length, it grew steadily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It looked like plain sailing then, but for some
unexplainable reason, after they had started the
line from the well, the valve started to leak.
Probably the tremendous pressure of the oil behind
it had opened up some little flaw in the gate
or seat, and oil started coming through—not in
any great quantity, to be sure, but still there was
a constant stream, which ran through the pipe
and made it difficult to join the sections together
and kept the men constantly dripping with the
thick brown liquid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom would not admit it, but he was worried.
He knew that the leak might get worse, that the
valve might give out altogether and release the
imprisoned oil. His first act was to telegraph
for a new valve. After that, he gave orders to
have the new pipe line disconnected close to the
well. This stopped the oil running through the
line, but of course it ran out into the ground instead
and trickled down the hill in every direction.
However, the leakage was not large as yet,
and if it got no worse would not be a serious
thing. It meant some loss of oil, but it would be
for only a few days, until they could get the
line connected to the tank in Copperhead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my forebodings! I don’t like it, just
the same,” said Mr. Damon, with a shake of his
head. “It takes away my confidence, Tom. If
that valve can leak a little, it can leak a lot, and
I expect almost any old time to hear it let go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s possible,” admitted Tom. “No use
worrying about it, though. I don’t like to see
our good oil going to waste any more than you
do, but I guess it won’t amount to very much,
after all. There’ll be plenty left in the well, Mr.
Damon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dat stuff doan look like oil, nohow,” said
Rad, who was an interested spectator of all that
was going on. “Dat looks mo’ lak good ole
molasses to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, maybe it is,” said Tom. “Taste it and
see, Rad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rad did as he was bidden, but instantly made
a terrible face and looked reproachfully at the
young inventor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it molasses, Rad?” asked Tom, trying hard
to keep a straight face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sah, dat ain’t no molasses. It’s de worst
stuff dat dis niggah evah tasted, an’ Ah doan
want no mo’ of it. Guess Ah’ll have to take a
good swig o’ watah to git de taste outen ma
mouf,” and Rad made for the water bucket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Live and learn,” laughed Mr. Damon, his
anxiety over the leak forgotten for the moment.
“Bless you, Rad, things aren’t always what they
seem.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah believes you-all now, Mistah Damon,”
said the old negro, as he ruefully scrubbed at his
lips in an effort to get rid of the taste. “Nex’
time Ah lets some odder fool niggah do de
samplin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night at the farmhouse, while the others
of the company were chatting about the events
of the day, Mr. Damon stepped to the window to
take note of the weather, as he was accustomed
to do. As he reached the window he gave a
startled exclamation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my fire insurance!” he cried. “There’s
a big fire. Looks as though it might be in Copperhead,
only it’s hardly far enough away for
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At his words, the others jumped up and
crowded to the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say it isn’t as far as Copperhead!”
ejaculated Tom. “Why, that fire is close, and
getting closer every minute!” and he dashed out
of the house, followed by the others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the north was a lurid glare, growing brighter
every moment. A fresh breeze blew toward
them, bearing a stifling smoke, with now and then
a floating spark. The long, dry grass was on
fire, and, blown by a lively breeze, was rapidly
approaching the oil well!</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXIV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>FIGHTING THE FIRE</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>The well!</span>” shouted Tom. “It’s coming toward
the well!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Terror gripped at the hearts of all. The men
stood for an instant as though paralyzed. Carol
wrung her hands in anguish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With this wind blowing, nothing can stop
it,” groaned Mr. Damon, his face white with excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But even if it gets that far, the well is
capped!” exclaimed Ned, catching at a shred of
hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’ll catch fire just the same,” said Tom, as
he remembered the leaking gate valve and the
oil-soaked hillside. “Once let the flames begin
to lick round that casing, and there’ll be a tremendous
explosion. Don’t let’s fool ourselves.
We’ve got to stop it—<span class='it'>got</span> to stop it! Carol, you
run to the ’phone. Call up the neighbors. Call
up Copperhead. Get all the fire-fighters you can.
You men come with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hankinshaw and his gang had done their
work well. The night was an ideal one for their
project, the wind being strong and from the north
where there were dense thickets and many trees
to furnish fuel for the fire, which was now advancing
at terrifying speed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everybody get shovels,” yelled Tom. “I’ll
get the men up,” and he dashed toward the cabin
where the drillers slept. Usually, Koku slept
there too, and Tom hoped to find him, for he
knew what the giant’s great strength and tireless
endurance were worth in an emergency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Luckily Koku was in the cabin with the men,
but it was almost impossible to get him awake.
The others had all rushed out with shovels and
axes before Tom finally shook him into consciousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s matter?” he muttered, as he scrambled
sleepily to his feet. “Time get up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You bet it is—high time,” replied Tom, and
the excitement in his voice effectually aroused the
faithful giant. “The woods to the north of the
oil well are on fire, and the flames are coming
toward us fast. We’ve got to put that fire out,
Koku.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do that,” declared Koku confidently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get a shovel and follow me,” ordered Tom.
“You might take an axe along too,” he added.
“The only chance we’ve got is to clear a space
ahead of the flames that they can’t jump over.
If we can do that, we may save the well yet,”
and he and Koku started at a fast run toward the
oncoming flames.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fire had not yet reached the oil belt, but
it was not over a mile from it when the young
inventor and his faithful giant arrived on the
scene. Everybody that could handle a shovel or
an axe was there, but they were working without
leadership until Tom arrived. He took control
at once, and in a few minutes everybody
knew just what he was expected to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time the heat of the fire was intense,
and the smoke enveloped those fighting it in a
stifling cloud. Hot sparks and embers floated
over their heads, and threatened at any moment
to kindle new fires nearer the oil well. Tom detailed
three of the drillers to watch for these incipient
fires and smother them or beat them out
before they got serious. Ned and Mr. Damon,
together with the rest of the drilling gang and
such of the neighbors as had come to help, he
put to work digging ditches and clearing the
ground in the path of the approaching flames of
its dried underbrush, while he and Koku set
about chopping down some of the trees that grew
on the hillside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were not large trees, scarcely more than
saplings in fact, but there were a great many of
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Koku,” shouted Tom, “work as you’ve
never worked before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me do,” answered the giant, as he tightened
his hold on the axe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom himself was an expert at wielding an axe,
and he swung with a tireless stroke that soon
showed results, but for every sapling that he
brought down Koku felled two. In the red glare
of the oncoming fire the giant worked like a
demon, his great muscles swelling and knotting
as he swung the blade of his axe in gleaming
circles. The heat increased until it became so
unbearable that everybody else had to fall back,
but he hardly seemed to feel it. He kept at work
until the fire was almost on top of him, and Tom
yelled to him to come back. But by that time
they had cut a long swath along the side of the
hill between the fire and the well. Other workers
had pretty well cleared up the underbrush
and drawn the bulk of it back, apparently out
of the reach of the oncoming flames.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they had reckoned without the wind, which
blew strongly and fanned the fire into a fury
that recognized no check. As it reached the
edge of the cleared space it died down slightly
while it ate along the edge as though it were endowed
with intelligence and was seeking out the
easiest place to cross. The scorched and weary
fire-fighters leaned on their tools and waited with
nerves tense to see if their efforts had prevailed.
Had the night been still, the red enemy would
have been conquered then and there from lack
of fuel to feed upon, but the wind rose until it
reached half a gale and carried on its wings blazing
leaves and twigs that alighted on the far
side of the cleared space. Here the fire found
fresh fuel to feed upon, and resumed its devastating
march toward the oil well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of the fire-fighters were ready to throw
down their tools and admit defeat. They had
seen the fire demon at work before, and they
knew how hard it was to bar his progress. Had
it been left to them, they would have given in
to what they considered the inevitable, and accepted
defeat. But Tom, like a famous American
commander, had “just begun to fight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on up farther, and we’ll try again!” he
yelled. “The wind is dying down a little, and
this time we may stop it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this time he resorted to a stronger force
than mere human labor. In a shack not far from
the well was stored some nitro-glycerine, which
they had bought when it seemed as though they
might have to explode it to strike oil. It was
not needed at that time, but now the thought of
it flashed through Tom’s mind, and he resolved
to try it. He figured that by exploding the powerful
nitro-glycerine he could plough up a deep
and wide trench that might effectually prevent the
further progress of the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, Koku!” he shouted, “I’ve got a job
for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Followed by his giant retainer, he set off for
the storage shack. When they reached it, Tom
reached in his pocket for the key to the padlock.
He fumbled about, but the key was gone—lost
in the mad activities of that lurid night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re up against it now, Koku!” exclaimed
the young inventor, in desperation. “We’ve got
to get into that shack, but the key is lost, and
that’s a strong padlock. How are we going to
do it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For answer, Koku seized the padlock and,
placing his foot against the door jamb, pulled
until his powerful muscles stood out in ridges.
There came a screech of nails being drawn
through wood, padlock and hasp came flying off
the door, while Koku staggered backward and
almost fell from the force of his own exertions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good enough!” exclaimed Tom. “Now,
Koku, this is dangerous stuff to handle. If we
fall with it, they’ll never be able to find the
pieces. Are you game to take the chance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What you tell me, I do,” replied Koku
calmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Each took all of the explosive he could carry
and started back toward the fire. It was a terribly
dangerous journey, as a fall would spell
disaster. The fire gave such a light, however,
that they could see as clearly as in daytime, and
it was not long before they had the high explosive
in place in front of the approaching flames.
Then all ran to a safe distance, while Tom set
the charge off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a terrific roar, and a cloud of gravel,
chips, and other debris went flying through the
air. When the smoke cleared away, the fire-fighters
saw that they had a broad trench for
hundreds of feet in both directions, with sand
and gravel heaped up in great piles along its
length.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It looked as though this would surely stop the
fire, and for a time it seemed as though their
hopes would be justified. The fire hesitated, and
died down until it seemed to be only smouldering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But suddenly a burning tree, almost uprooted
by the explosion, toppled across the ditch, and
before Tom or any of the others could get to
the spot, the fire had taken hold again, and was
rapidly spreading. All their work was wasted,
and the fire was a good deal nearer the well than
when they had started!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still they fought on doggedly, blistered and
smoke-begrimed. Carol and other women passed
up and down the line with coffee and sandwiches.
Tom and Ned were here, there and everywhere,
working feverishly and cheering on the men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re goners though, old boy!” groaned Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never say die!” panted Tom, feigning a confidence
he was far from feeling. “We’ll beat it
yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when the morning came, the fire was still
gaining—gaining only by inches now in the desperate
battle—but gaining. The gallant host of
weary men still fought on, but they fought like
men at bay, looking into the fiery eyes of doom!</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>VICTORY</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Tom was</span> as near despair as he ever permitted
himself to be. It looked as though the well was
doomed. Even though it was capped, he knew
that if it became the center of those devouring
flames the steel would melt and the fire come in
contact with the oil. And this meant a catastrophe
so appalling that none could foresee the
consequences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was not in his nature to quit, and he
cudgeled his brain desperately to find some way
of averting the calamity. Suddenly a thought
came to him like an inspiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come along, Ned. You too, Koku,” he
shouted. “Mr. Damon, you keep the men working.”
And without waiting for an answer the
young inventor started on a run for the <span class='it'>Winged
Arrow</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned and Koku were close on his heels when
he reached the giant plane. Fortunately, it was
always kept in readiness for instant flight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jump in!” he shouted to his companions, setting
the example.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He started the engine and the plane soared into
the air and turned its nose toward Copperhead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ned,” he said, “those fire bombs of ours!
We shipped a lot of them to Southern cities.
Which is the nearest town that has some? Think
quickly, old boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned caught on to Tom’s idea instantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We sent a lot of them to Dallas,” he replied.
“A big shipment went to Wesson and Robbins
of that place. No doubt they have some of them
on hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!” cried the young inventor. “There’s
a flying field on the outskirts of that town. I’ll
let you down as near to Copperhead as possible.
You rush to the office and get Wesson and Robbins
on the long distance ’phone. Tell them to
have a dozen of them at the flying field when I
get there. I won’t wait for you, but put right
out for Dallas on the chance. It’s nearly a hundred
miles, but the <span class='it'>Winged Arrow</span> will make it
in an hour. You hotfoot it back to the farm—get
an auto or a horse—and take charge there
till I get back. Keep the fire down as much as
you can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll do it,” said Ned. “Great head, old boy.
Good luck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In two minutes more they were close to Copperhead.
Tom swooped down, let Ned get out,
and then with a whiz and a whirr rose and made
for Dallas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fire bombs to which Tom referred were
of his own invention and had achieved such remarkable
results that they had been adopted by
fire departments all over the United States.
They contained chemicals of which Tom held
the secret that were of wonderful efficiency in
extinguishing fire. Tom had demonstrated their
value on many occasions, notably when he had
saved a great office building in a city not far
from Shopton by dropping from an airplane the
bombs containing the chemicals directly on the
apparently doomed building, as narrated in the
volume of this series entitled: “Tom Swift
Among the Fire Fighters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom’s mind was a tumult of stormy thoughts.
Would Wesson and Robbins have the bombs?
Would Ned be able to get his message through
in time? Even if these things went smoothly,
would he get back before the flames reached the
well, making all his efforts go for naught?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he did not let these thoughts take his mind
off the plane. This was vital. If the plane
broke down, all hope would be gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he urged and coaxed the plane along, pressing
it to the utmost speed he dared. This was
a race—a race against fire—a race against time!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before long he could see the towers and
steeples of the city in the distance. He neared
it rapidly, straining his eyes to catch sight of
the flying field with its white signals for the
guidance of airmen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, there it was, and luckily on this side of
the city. He swooped down and made his landing
in close proximity to a loaded truck that he
guessed might contain the bombs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he jumped out and ran toward it, he saw
with a thrill of exultation the name of Wesson
and Robbins on the truck. Ned had got the message
through. Good old Ned!</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the work of only a few minutes with
the aid of Koku and the two burly truckmen to
get the bombs transferred to the plane. And
Tom blessed his stars that he had brought the
big plane South with him instead of one of his
smaller airships.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a hurried word of thanks, Tom jumped
into his seat and started on his homeward journey.
On the way he instructed Koku to hold
himself in readiness to drop the bombs when he
should give the word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In less than an hour, which seemed to him like
an eternity, he had passed Copperhead. He had
been straining his ears for the sound of an explosion
and thanked heaven when it failed to
come. But the angry glare that grew more vivid
as he approached told him that the fire demon
was still trying to get at its prey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In another minute or two he was circling above
the Goby farm. Beneath him he could see men
running for cover. He knew that Ned had seen
him coming, and had ordered the men to disperse
so that they would escape danger from the falling
bombs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could see the flames eating their way ruthlessly
toward the well, and only a few yards
away from it. He steadied the airplane as nearly
above the flames as possible. Koku was holding
one of the bombs in readiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now!” cried Tom, and the giant dropped the
bomb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It fell about a hundred feet from the well, right
in the midst of a seething caldron of flame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The effect was instantaneous. The fire died
out in a twinkling. For a wide area the red
turned to black. Even the smoke disappeared
and was replaced by a cloud of vapor that was
slowly dissipated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were too high to hear the cheers that
rose from the fire-fighters looking on, but Tom
could see them waving their hats and hands and
jumping up and down like mad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Koku held another bomb poised aloft, and
again at a signal from Tom he let it fall. It
struck in a different place this time, but with the
same result. In the vicinity where it struck, the
flames went out as though some wizard had
turned a switch and extinguished them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several times this was repeated until Tom saw
that the flames had been definitely conquered.
Only little scattered patches were left, and these
could easily be put out by hand. The young inventor
had won the fight!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only when he was sure of this did he swoop
down to his usual landing place and get out, to
be overwhelmed with cheers and handshakings
and thumpings by Ned and Mr. Damon and the
host of grimy fire-fighters with blackened hands
and faces, all of them almost crazy with joy.
What little was left to do was quickly done, and
before long every spark had been extinguished.
The well was saved!</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a tired but happy group that sat in the
living room of the Goby farmhouse that night.
Mr. Goby’s face was beaming. Mr. Damon
was blessing everything and everybody.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the kitchen, Koku was boasting of his exploits
and Rad was belittling them, the only thing
on which they agreed being that although there
were some great men in the world, there was
none so great as “Marse Tom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly the door of the living room was
flung open and a stalwart young fellow rushed in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every one looked up, startled by the unceremonious
irruption. Carol sprang to her feet
with a joyous cry, ran toward the newcomer, and
threw her arms about his neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Father!” she cried, “it’s Hitt! It’s
brother! He’s come back to us!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The blind man tried to rise, but fell back in
his chair. The next instant his son and daughter
were beside him and he folded them in his
arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom rose, followed by Ned and Mr. Damon,
and tiptoed into the adjoining room, leaving the
reunited family to themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they were called back before long, and
Tom and Ned were overwhelmed with thanks by
Hitt Goby for the way they had rescued him
from death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he’s going to stay at home with us now
for good,” announced Carol happily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Probably there was no happier home in Texas
that night than the Goby farmhouse. Carol was
in the seventh heaven of delight, her father’s
face was radiant, Hitt Goby was joyous. The
happiness of the others, while perhaps not so rapturous,
was not less real.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Tom among the intervals of talk and
laughter was thinking of—Mary. He was counting
the hours before he could be back with her
and share with her his triumphs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But before that wished-for moment could be
reached, there were many things that imperatively
claimed his attention. He had a fortune
in his well and in the other leases and purchases
he had made in connection with his associates.
And there was another fortune, and perhaps a
bigger one, in that marvelous drill, whose
achievements had so interested the captains of
finance that offers for the patent rights were beginning
to flow in on him from all directions.
The first, and so far the best one, was from the
company represented by Mr. Blythe. Some of
these things had to be attended to by Tom personally
and at once, but whatever was possible he
left to Ned and Mr. Damon to adjust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had put inquiries on foot to find out the
source of the mysterious fire, and one day was
apprised by Judge Wilson that Hankinshaw had
been arrested. One of the confederates he had
employed had been arrested for another offense,
and with the hope of getting a lighter sentence
had revealed the incendiary plot. Warrants were
out also for Thompson and Bragden, but those
worthies had already put half a continent between
them and their pursuers and had not yet
been apprehended. Hankinshaw, however, was
less lucky, and some time later was tried and sent
to prison for a five-year term.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s one rascal that’s got his deserts,” remarked
Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not by a jugful!” exclaimed Ned. “He
ought to have got twice as much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my lockstep!” snorted Mr. Damon.
“They should have sent him up for life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, who cares?” Tom summed it up.
“The main thing is that he didn’t get away with
it. We won out. The whole thing’s been a
great adventure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Goby family could not get over what Tom
had done for them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a friend worth having,” was the way
Hitt Goby expressed himself. “If it wasn’t for
you, I don’t know where I’d be to-day. Most
likely in the cemetery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, perhaps not as bad as that,” returned the
young inventor modestly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And see what he has done for the whole family!”
cried Carol, her eyes sparkling. “Why, this
oil is going to make Father rich.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s making us rich, too,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But think of what might have happened if we
had put ourselves in the hands of those rascals,”
came from Mr. Goby. “I tell you, Tom Swift,
you are one young man out of a million!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The best ever,” murmured Hitt. “I’ll bank on
him every time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So will I,” laughed Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom could not stand all this praise, so he merely
smiled and turned away. Yet it pleased him
greatly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other adventures are still in store for Tom
Swift, but these must be kept for another volume.
For the present we will leave him with his
great success in making a wonderful improvement
in oil-well machinery and bringing in his
Great Oil Gusher.</p>
